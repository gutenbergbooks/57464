<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
I, REGINALD KINGSNORTH
</h3>

<p>
"Reggie, do you remember Wildacre?"
</p>

<p>
It was with this apparently simple question that
Arthur Blathwayte rang up the curtain on the drama
of my life.
</p>

<p>
That the performance was late in beginning I cannot
but admit.  I was fully forty-two; an age at which
the drama of most men's lives are over&mdash;or, at any
rate, well on in the third act.  But in my uneventful
existence there had been no drama at all; not even an
ineffective love-affair that could be dignified by the
name of a "curtain-raiser."
</p>

<p>
Of course I had perceived that some women were
better looking than others, and more attractive and
easier to get on with.  But I had only perceived this
in a scientific, impersonal kind of way: the perception
had in nowise penetrated my inner consciousness or
influenced my existence.  I was the type of person who
is described by the populace as "not a marrying
sort," and consequently I had reached the age of
forty-two without either marrying or wishing to
marry.
</p>

<p>
I admit that I had not been thrown into circumstances
conducive to the cultivation of the tender passion;
my sister Annabel had seen to that; but no sister&mdash;be
she even as powerful as Annabel herself&mdash;can
prevent a man from falling in love if he be so minded,
nor from seeking out for himself a woman to fall in
love with if none are thrown in his way.  But I had not
been so minded; therefore Annabel's precautions had
triumphed.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was one of that by no means inconsiderable
number of women who constantly say they desire and
think they desire one thing, while they are actually
wishing and working for the exact opposite.  For
instance, she was always remarking how much she wished
that I would marry&mdash;and what a mistake it was for a
man like myself to remain single&mdash;and what a pity it
was for the baronetcy to die out.  And she said this
in all sincerity: there was never any conscious humbug
about Annabel.  Yet if by any chance a marriageable
maiden came my way, Annabel hustled her off as she
hustled off the peacocks when they came into the
flower-garden.  My marriage was in theory one of
Annabel's fondest hopes: in practice a catastrophe to
be averted at all costs.
</p>

<p>
My sister was five years my senior, and had
mothered me ever since my mother's death when I
was a boy.  There were only the two of us, and surely
no man ever had a better sister than I had.  In my
childhood she stood between me and danger; in my
youth between me and discipline; and in my
manhood between me and discomfort.  As far as in her
lay she had persistently shielded me from all life's
disagreeables; and a great deal of shielding power
lay in Annabel.  Of course she ought to have been
the son and I the daughter: my mother said it when
we were children, and my father never tired of
saying it when we were grown up, and I myself fully
realised the force of the remark.  But I didn't see
that I could do anything, or that it was in any way
my fault, though my father always spoke as if he
thought it were: as if in some occult way Annabel's
unselfishness and my carelessness were responsible for
this mistake in sex: and as if she had deliberately
stood on one side in order that the honour of
manhood should fall upon me.
</p>

<p>
I consider that my father was in many ways a
really great man.
</p>

<p>
Of comparatively humble origin, he raised himself
by his own efforts into a position of commercial
importance&mdash;amassed a considerable fortune&mdash;threw
himself heart and soul into political life, serving his
party and his country with both zeal and efficiency&mdash;and
died at last, full of days and honours, beloved
and admired by his friends, and revered by the
country at large.
</p>

<p>
And I cannot help seeing that&mdash;through no fault
of my own&mdash;a disappointment I, his only son, must
have been to him.  I say advisedly, "through no fault
of my own," though I have faults enough, Heaven
knows!  The great tragedy of my life came through
my own folly, as I now at last realise: but I cannot
see that the disappointment I caused my father was
my own doing, though the far greater disappointment
I caused to one dearer than my father most
undoubtedly was.  But of that later.
</p>

<p>
I was exactly the sort of son that my father ought
not to have had: in modern parlance he had no use
for me.  His son should have resembled himself, and
should have been able to go on where he left off.
As for me, I was of no good at the business, and of
still less in politics: I could neither turn his thousands
into tens of thousands, nor his baronetcy into a
peerage; for I was endowed with a fatal capacity for
sitting still.  If that above-mentioned mistake of
Nature had not been made, and Annabel had been the
boy, imagination fails to depict the heights to which
she might not have risen with her father's wealth
and position for a leaping-board: for, like her father,
Annabel was dowered with the gift of Success, whilst
I had the gift of Failure.
</p>

<p>
It is strange how some people, of whom I, alas! am
one, possess the capacity to fail in whatsoever
they undertake.  I do not think it is altogether a
fault, as we cannot help it: it seems rather an
inherent quality, such as height or size or complexion.
Even in childhood Annabel's things always turned
out well, and mine turned out badly.  Her garden
blossomed like the rose, while mine was more or less
a desert place, though I worked in it quite as hard
as she: her white mice were ornaments to society,
while mine grew into rats and had to be destroyed;
her birthdays were invariably fine, while mine, equally
invariably, turned to rain.
</p>

<p>
When I was young this quality of failure terribly
distressed and depressed me; but age&mdash;or rather
middle age&mdash;brings, in exchange for the many things it
takes away, the gift of philosophy; and by the time
I was forty I accepted the fact that I was a failure
with much the same resignation that I accepted the
facts that I was short-sighted and too narrow in the
shoulders for my height.  True, I was now and again
haunted by the feeling that I had lived in a backwater,
and had never tasted the living waters, nor
felt the fierce swirl of the river of life as it rushed by
on its headlong course, and that I was getting too old
now ever to taste and to feel these things; but this
regret was soon smothered by the beauty of my backwater,
and my contentment in the lot which had been
ordained for me.
</p>

<p>
Now that I am older I can see that though this
quality of Failure is very trying to those who are
so unfortunate as to possess it, it is also very
irritating to all the successful people round about.  And
this fills me with wonder and gratitude when I
remember the patience that my father and Annabel
always showed towards me, who was so differently
constituted from themselves.  In spite of his
disappointment in me, my father always showed me the
greatest kindness and affection, and it is a comfort
to me to remember that though I was not a son of
whom he could be proud, I was never one of whom
he could feel ashamed.  I could not do the things
that he would have had me do: but I studiously left
undone anything of which I knew he would have
disapproved.  That seemed the only reparation I could
make for having been the boy and allowed Annabel
to be the girl.
</p>

<p>
My father did not marry until late in life; and my
mother, though considerably his junior, was by no
means young at the time of her marriage.  This,
perhaps, accounts for the fact that Annabel and I
seem always to have been middle-aged.  Our home
was a happy one, but there was no element of youth
in it.  We were surrounded by every comfort and
luxury, but enjoyed less actual pleasure than did most
young people of our age and generation.  My mother
was a woman of good family, and as poor as she was
proud, and I always think she must have had her
romance with some one of her own age and rank
before ever she met her middle-aged husband, but that
the quality of failure, which she handed on to me,
doomed that romance to disappointment.
</p>

<p>
It was after he had received his baronetcy that my
father bought the Restham estate and married Lady
Jane Winterford; so Restham Manor has always been
my home&mdash;surely one of the loveliest and dearest
homes that man ever had.
</p>

<p>
I was considered a delicate boy, and so was educated
(mistakenly, as I now think) by tutors at home;
thus I missed the inestimable advantage of public-school
life, a loss which can never be made up in after
years.  It is to this loss, perhaps, that I owe the
shyness and sensitiveness which I have never been able
to outgrow; and there is no doubt that my home
education fostered the feminine side of my character&mdash;a
side already too much developed.
</p>

<p>
I went to Magdalen College, Oxford, and took a
third in Mods. and Greats; and then&mdash;to please my
father&mdash;was called to the Bar, but never to a brief.
And before I had waited long for the brief that never
came, my father died, and I inherited his title and
estates, and I then settled down to the life of a
country squire&mdash;to my mind the most delightful lot in the
world for an unambitious man like myself&mdash;with
Annabel to keep house for me, as she had done for my
father.
</p>

<p>
It was not long after this that the old rector of
Restham died, and I presented to the living my
college friend, Arthur Blathwayte.  Since then he had
well and wisely attended to the spiritual needs of
the parish, under the ægis of Annabel, who had
from her childhood ruled over the whole village of
Restham.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was a most regular church-goer: our Sunday's
dinner was always fixed at an hour which gave
her time to attend the evening service and change
into a black evening dress.  Annabel would have died
at the stake rather than not change her dress for
dinner; but she always wore black on Sunday evenings,
as a sort of concession to the day.  She went to
church for three reasons: to worship God, to save
her own soul, and to see that Arthur Blathwayte
didn't do anything ritualistic.
</p>

<p>
Every spring Annabel stood between me and the
East wind by insisting on our going abroad together
for February and March.  There was not the slightest
reason for any coolness, so to speak, between the
East wind and me: I was as capable of meeting it in
the teeth as is any normal Englishman; but my sister
condemned it as one of the disagreeable things of
life, and therefore felt herself in honour bound to
stand between me and it.  But she also felt herself
bound to return before the end of Lent, in case&mdash;without
her restraining presence&mdash;Blathwayte should
be led into any ritualism on Easter Day.
</p>

<p>
And it was on the day of our return home from
one of these East-wind-eluding excursions, when
Arthur and I were smoking after dinner in the Manor
dining-room, that he asked the curtain-raising
question: "Reggie, do you remember Wildacre?"
</p>

<p>
Of course I remembered him; who that had ever
known Wildacre could help remembering him?  And
the memory conjured up a vision of one of the most
attractive personalities I had ever met.  Wildacre
had been a friend of Blathwayte's and mine at
Oxford; but after we left college the friendship had
gradually fizzled out, owing to the extreme (not to
say dull) respectability of Arthur and myself, and the
exact opposite on the part of Wildacre.  But what
charm he had&mdash;what superabundant vitality&mdash;what
artistic genius!  All of which came back to me with
a rush as I answered Arthur's question.
</p>

<p>
"Remember Wildacre?  <i>Rather</i>!  But why?  Have
you heard anything about him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Blathwayte in his turn.  "I've heard
a good deal while you've been abroad.  In fact, I've
seen him."
</p>

<p>
"Seen him!  Lucky old Arthur!  I should like to
see him too.  It would almost make one young again
to see Wildacre."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it didn't exactly have that effect, as he was
dying, you see."
</p>

<p>
Wildacre dying!  The idea seemed impossible.
Wildacre had always been so full of life that one
couldn't imagine him and Death hobnobbing; they
could have nothing in common with each other!  And
as to that Other Life beyond the grave&mdash;in which in
my own way I believed quite as firmly as did
Arthur&mdash;one couldn't imagine Wildacre at home there
either.
</p>

<p>
"Wildacre mustn't die yet!" I exclaimed; "not till
he's done something with all that genius of his and
that overflowing energy!  I couldn't bear to think
of his dying until he's made a name for himself.
Wildacre is a real poet, and he'll be a great poet some
day."
</p>

<p>
Blathwayte shook his head.  "He once might have
been; he had it in him, but he lost his opportunity,
and lost opportunities don't return."
</p>

<p>
"No, Arthur, you are right there.  There is no
bringing the shadow on the dial ten degrees backward.
What is past is past, and what is written is
written, and Fate sends us no revise proofs to correct.
The youth we wasted or frittered or abused or ignored
never comes back to us to be lived over again, though
we may shout ourselves hoarse with crying for it."  And
for the moment the backwater feeling rushed
over me with such force that I felt almost suffocated
with the hopeless pain of it.  "That is the real
tragedy of life," I went on, "that there are no encores."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Wildacre had it in him to do great things,"
said Arthur, "but he lost his chance.  At least he
did worse than lose it; he threw it away to the swine,
and trampled it among the husks."
</p>

<p>
"But he may do something even yet," I argued.
</p>

<p>
"Genius&mdash;and Wildacre had genius&mdash;never grows old.
And, hang it all, man, he isn't so old after all!  He
is only two or three years older than we are, and
we aren't really old&mdash;only buried alive, which is quite
a different thing.  If we lived in London instead of
in the blessed, peaceful country, we should still be
considered young men about town.  Mind you, I'm
not grumbling: I should hate to be a young man
about town, and I enjoy being buried alive; but I
kick at being called old at forty-two.  It's positively
libellous!"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't because Wildacre is old that he won't do
anything now," replied Arthur simply; "but because
he is dead."
</p>

<p>
The words came to me with a shock.  Though it
was twenty years since I had seen Wildacre, I had
never forgotten the vividness of his personality;
somewhere at the back of my mind there had been
a subconscious thought that he and I would meet
again some day and pick up the thread of that
friendship which at one time had meant so much
to me.  And now he was dead, and I should
never see his handsome, laughing face again!  The
world seemed suddenly to have grown colder and
darker.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all about it," I said, lighting another
cigarette with hands that trembled: and Arthur
told me.
</p>

<p>
"Not long after you and Miss Kingsnorth had left
England last February, to my great surprise I received
a letter from Wildacre.  In it he told me that he had
spent the last twenty years of his life in Australia,
but was stricken with a mortal disease, and had come
home to die."
</p>

<p>
"Where did he write from?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"From lodgings in West Kensington.  He wrote
further that his time was short, and he wanted to
consult me about his affairs before he died.  So I
went at once."
</p>

<p>
A wave of intense regret swept over me that I had
not been at home at the time so that I, too, could
have seen Wildacre.  And I was also conscious of a
pang that he had written to Blathwayte in his need
and not to me.  The thought of my own ineffectiveness
stabbed me once again in the place where it had
stabbed me so often that the wound never really
healed.  So I was a failure even in friendship, as in
everything else!
</p>

<p>
But all I said was, "Well?"
</p>

<p>
Arthur went on in his plodding way: it was always
impossible to hurry him: "I found him a good deal
altered.  In spite of your notion that genius never
grows old, he looked a good ten years older than you
do, Reggie."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I'm not old; only buried alive."
</p>

<p>
But Arthur took no notice of my interruption.  That
is where he was always so restful to be with: he
plodded along in his own way, utterly unconscious of
any fret or worry or interruption.  This was his
custom in great things as well as in little ones.  In my
own mind I always applied to him the words of Bacon:
he "rested on Providence, moved in Charity, and
turned upon the poles of Truth."  But I do not
attempt to deny that both in moving and turning he
never exceeded a speed limit of eight miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
"Of course Wildacre was very ill, and that made
him look still older; but one could see at a glance
that he was a fellow who had gone the pace.  His
hair was quite grey, and his face deeply lined."
</p>

<p>
"Yet he wasn't so much older than we are."  It
was always better to humour Arthur when he was
telling a story.  If one attempted to hustle him
he stumbled and fell, and had to begin all over
again.
</p>

<p>
"But you look the youngest, Reggie.  You are very
young looking for your age.  If you didn't wear
a beard, I believe you'd still be taken for a mere
boy."
</p>

<p>
"You go on about Wildacre," I remonstrated, "and
never mind my beard."  I was not hustling, I was
merely gently guiding.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he told me that he had married nearly
twenty years ago&mdash;an actress or a dancer or somebody
of that kind, and that she died ten years later, leaving
him with a twin son and daughter.  His wife was
an Australian, and he had lived out there ever since
his marriage until he came home to die."
</p>

<p>
"Was she beautiful?"  But the moment I had
asked it I felt it was a superfluous question.  Of
course she was, otherwise Wildacre would not have
loved her: the more sterling qualities never appealed
to him.  The dramatic force of the whole situation
seized upon me: the brilliant poet being bewitched
by a beautiful dancer, and for her sake banishing
himself to the Antipodes.  There was an air of adventure
about the whole thing that stirred my blood, it was
so far removed from anything in my decorous and
commonplace experience.  Beautiful dancers do not
grow in backwaters.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't an idea," replied Arthur; "Wildacre
didn't say anything about her looks, and it never
occurred to me to ask him what she was like.
Besides, it would have been an impertinence."
</p>

<p>
"I know it would, but I should have asked him,
nevertheless, if I had been in your place.  It is a
great mistake to allow the fear of being impertinent
to prevent one from obtaining useful and interesting
information.  But were there no photographs of her
about the place?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, I never noticed any; but you know
I am a poor hand at noticing things," replied Arthur,
with some truth.
</p>

<p>
I nodded.  "Pray don't mention it; it is a
peculiarity of yours too obvious to require remark.  But
for goodness' sake get on about Wildacre!"
</p>

<p>
"To cut a long story short," said Arthur (a thing,
by the way, which he was constitutionally incapable
of doing), "he explained to me that he had sent for
me because all his own relations were dead, and his
wife's people, though well-to-do, had risen from too
humble a rank of life to be entrusted altogether with
the upbringing of his children, and he did not think
it fair to the children to trust them after his death
into an inferior social position to that to which they
had been born.  They would be comfortably provided
for&mdash;about eight hundred a year each&mdash;but he felt
they must have some one of his own rank of life to
look after them until they were of age and capable
of looking after themselves.  You see, Reggie, there
are so many temptations to beset the feet of the
young&mdash;and especially if they have no competent person to
guide and shelter them."
</p>

<p>
"Skip the temptations of the young," I said, "and
get on with Wildacre's death."
</p>

<p>
Blathwayte's amiability was imperturbable, so he
merely smiled indulgently as he endeavoured, as far
as in him lay, to obey my behest.  He was an excellent
fellow in every respect, and I had the deepest
regard and affection for him, but he was apt to drop
into preaching unless carefully watched.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, to come to the point, he wanted to
know if I would consent to be the children's guardian
until they came of age.  There was no one else he
should be so happy to leave them with, he said; but
he felt that, being a parson, I should look after them
and see that they didn't get into mischief, and all that,
don't you know!"
</p>

<p>
This was a bomb-shell indeed: the reverend and
middle-aged Arthur suddenly converted into an
amateur <i>pater-familias</i>!
</p>

<p>
"And you consented?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  What else could I do when Wildacre
asked me, and he was dying?"  That was exactly
like Arthur: the thought of himself, and of the upset
to his peaceful bachelor existence by the advent of
two children into the well-ordered rectory, never once
entered into his calculations.
</p>

<p>
"What age are they?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Eighteen.  They are both leaving school this term,
and the boy is dreadfully backward; I am going to
cram him for Oxford."
</p>

<p>
We were both silent for a moment; then I felt myself
smiling.  "It will be rather fun, don't you think?"
I ventured to remark.
</p>

<p>
Arthur smiled too.  "That has occurred to me also.
It will be such a change to have young things about
the place with all their faults and fripperies and
follies."
</p>

<p>
I heartily agreed with him.  "It will; for you and
Annabel and I have been getting terribly middle-aged
lately.  I've noticed it; particularly in the case of you
and Annabel.  And what are their names?"
</p>

<p>
"If you remember, Wildacre's name was Francis."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't ask what Wildacre's name was," I murmured
persuasively.  "I asked what his children are
called."
</p>

<p>
"After him."
</p>

<p>
"Not both of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, both; he said his wife insisted in calling both
the children after him; so their names are Francis
and Frances."
</p>

<p>
"How absurd!" I said; but all the same it was an
absurdity that I rather liked.  It showed how foolish
and sentimental and unpractical the beautiful little
dancer had been; and I had always lived in such
an atmosphere of wise reasonableness and practical
common sense that anything wild and foolish and
unpractical never failed to exercise a certain charm
for me.  Annabel always strongly objected to the
same initials being repeated in a family, as she said
"it made it so confusing for the laundress."  I quite
saw Annabel's point in this matter, and applauded
it; I should greatly have objected, owing to any
confusion in initials, to have had her clean undergarments
substituted for mine; but all the same I could not
help feeling a sort of unholy admiration for the
woman in whose eyes the claims of the laundry were
non-existent.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't really as confusing as it sounds," Arthur
explained; "as the boy is always called Frank, and
the girl Fay."
</p>

<p>
"What nice names!" I exclaimed.  "Frank sounds
so typically schoolboyish, and Fay so utterly
fairy-like and irresponsible."
</p>

<p>
Blathwayte's good-humoured face grew serious
again.  "Poor children, to lose their father and
mother so young!  Wildacre lived about a month after
that, and I saw him frequently.  I was with him when
he died.  It was quite peaceful at the end, and I think
he was glad to have me with him."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've seen the children?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Several times.  They are wonderfully alike,
with&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But I stopped him with a wave of the hand.  "Please
don't describe them; I hate to have either places or
people described to me beforehand; I like to form my
own impressions for myself."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it will be a great responsibility," Blathwayte
said thoughtfully; "but perhaps you'll help me
a bit when I get into a fix."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be of any use, but I'm sure Annabel will.
She's splendid with young people, she is so kind and
sensible; and she'll give you a helping hand whenever
you are in need of one."
</p>

<p>
"I always think Miss Kingsnorth would have made
an admirable stepmother."
</p>

<p>
"Of course she would," I cried, as usual waxing
eloquent over my sister's perfections; "but when you
come to that, she'd have made an admirable Prime
Minister or Archbishop of Canterbury.  There is no
office which Annabel is not competent adequately to
fill!"
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what she will think about the whole
affair; and whether she will consider I have made a
mistake, and am not worthy of the responsibility which
Wildacre has thrust upon me."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go and ask her," I replied, rising from
the table and throwing the end of my cigarette into
the ash-tray.
</p>

<p>
Whereat we both left the dining-room and went into
the great hall adjoining it, where Annabel was sitting
by the fire knitting socks for me.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
RESTHAM MANOR
</h3>

<p>
The village of Restham&mdash;where I was born and
brought up, and where later I sinned and suffered
and repented&mdash;lay in a hollow in that long, low range
of Kentish hills known as the North Downs.  The
road northwards was a steep ascent to the top of the
hill, from whence one saw spread at one's feet the
glorious panorama of the Weald of Kent.  To a
traveller coming down the hill the village seemed to lie
in a sheltered and secluded valley.  On the right of
the slope was the rectory&mdash;a fine old white house,
surrounded by a beautiful park and gardens.  Then,
lower down, was the village square, with its
half-timbered inn and cottages, and its grand, twelfth-century
church.  I don't know that the church itself was
different from most churches of its date, except in
one particular: just outside the building itself, at the
west end, was a vaulted passage leading from north
to south, in the middle of which was a large window,
from which one looked right up to the high altar.
Opposite to this window and set in the walls of the
passage was a stone brought, during one of the earlier
Crusades, from Palestine.  The pilgrims of the Middle
Ages, in travelling from London to Canterbury, passed
through Restham and along the vaulted passage,
saying a prayer at the holy stone as they went by, and
their countless fingers&mdash;as year by year and century
by century they made the Sign of the Cross upon the
stone&mdash;engraved the Symbol thereon, as if it had been
carved by a chisel; and there it stands to this day,
an indelible testimony to the faith of our fathers in
the days that are gone.
</p>

<p>
The church stood on the east side of the village
square; immediately beyond it the road turned sharp
to the east towards Canterbury, leaving on its left
the ruins of an archi-episcopal palace, and on the west
side of the square the road turned equally sharply
to the right towards Sevenoaks.  On the south side
of the square&mdash;exactly opposite the road which came
down the hill&mdash;were the gates of Restham Manor
House: heavy old oak gates, studded with huge
iron nails, and set in a fine old wall of that
rose-coloured brick which only the Tudors seemed able to
manufacture.  The house inside the walls was of the
same brick, with stone mullioned windows and twisted
chimneys, and was considered one of the most
perfectly preserved specimens of Tudor architecture in
Kent.  The heavily-studded front door led straight
into a great hall: a hall made beautiful by its
carved-oak roof and chimney-piece, and its black-and-white
marble floor, and comfortable by the numerous rugs
and tapestries which my father and I had spent years
in collecting.  It was in this hall that Annabel and I
chiefly lived and moved and had our being.  Out of
it, on the left of the huge fire-place, two steps and a
door led up to the drawing-room&mdash;a typical
"withdrawing-room" of the olden times; and on the right
of the fire-place another door opened into a corridor,
which in turn led to the dining-room, the library, the
staircase, and finally to the kitchen department.
Upstairs the whole front of the house was taken up by
an oak-pannelled picture-gallery, from the windows
of which one learned what a mistake one had made in
imagining that Restham lay at the bottom of the hill;
for below it the ground still sloped away and away,
fading at last into the blue distance of the Weald of
Kent.
</p>

<p>
Such was the spot which I had the happiness to call
home, and which played its part&mdash;as I believe all
natural surroundings do&mdash;in the formation of my
character.  Surely it was from the natural beauty
around me from my birth that I derived my appreciation
of&mdash;nay, rather my passion for&mdash;beauty in all its
forms, and from the peculiar spiritual atmosphere of
a place which pilgrim feet had trod for centuries,
and on which pilgrim fingers had traced the Sign of
the Cross, that I imbibed that pervading
consciousness of the unseen world surrounding us, and
that unquestioning acceptance of the phenomena which
men call miracles, which have been the most powerful
influences of my life, and which are as strong in me
to-day as they were when I was a child.
</p>

<p>
It was in the oak-pannelled dining-room, which
commanded a view of the sunny garden and of the blue
distance beyond, that Annabel and I were sitting at
breakfast the morning after Blathwayte had
imparted to us his astounding news.  Naturally we were
discussing the absorbing theme.  This intense interest
in one's neighbours' affairs may appear strange to
dwellers in cities; but to any one who has lived in
that day of small things in which is the epitome of
village life it will seem the most natural thing in the
world.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was looking particularly well that morning.
She was always rather handsome, in a stately,
sandy-haired, Queen Elizabethan sort of way; but our trip
to Madeira had revived and refreshed her, and had
elevated her always excellent health to a still higher
degree of excellence.  We were both tall, but Annabel
was a far finer specimen of humanity than I was
(another proof of the heinousness of my mistake in not
insisting upon her being the son and me the daughter
of the house of Kingsnorth), and while she had
inherited my father's fair hair and ruddy complexion,
I was dark and pale like my mother.  I remember
we once went to a fancy-dress ball at Canterbury as
Queen Elizabeth and Charles the First, and our
friends said we were exactly like the originals.  How
our friends knew this I am at a loss to imagine; but
I give their opinion for what it is worth.  If brown
eyes and hair and a pointed brown beard constitute a
resemblance to the ill-fated monarch and martyr, then
I certainly could boast that resemblance; but I had
neither been accused of losing my head nor of breaking
my coronation oath&mdash;at least not at the time when
this story begins.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot imagine how Arthur Blathwayte will
manage with those Wildacre children," remarked
Annabel; "he will have to come to me for advice.  You
see he has had no experience in bringing up young
people."
</p>

<p>
"Neither have you, my dear, when it comes to that,"
I ventured to suggest.
</p>

<p>
"But I know all about it through being so long an
active associate of the G.F.S.  And, besides, I brought
up you."
</p>

<p>
"I should advise you to go to the G.F.S. for a
testimonial.  I am no credit to you."
</p>

<p>
Annabel smiled indulgently; she had smiled at me
indulgently all my forty-two years.  "It will be
rather a pleasant change to have some fresh young
people to influence and educate; don't you think so,
Reggie?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!" I exclaimed.  "I am expecting
them to influence and educate me."
</p>

<p>
"How absurd!  As if children of that age could
teach a clever man like you anything!"
</p>

<p>
"But I expect them to teach me everything, Annabel;
everything that I've been too stupid and idle and
lethargic to learn for myself."
</p>

<p>
The afterglow of Annabel's indulgent smile still
lingered.  "You do talk a lot of nonsense, Reggie!"
</p>

<p>
"What is nonsense to you is sense to me, and vice
versa," I explained.  "To me you appear to be uttering
balderdash when you talk about the G.F.S. and
the S.P.G., and the S.P.C.K., and seams, and
stitches, and purling, and running, and felling; but
to you these cabalistic signs embody the wisdom of
the ages.  And in the same way my wisdom is
foolishness to you."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd look over Green's bill for seeds this
spring," said Annabel, foraging among her letters and
throwing a rather dirty envelope at me; "I think he
has charged too much for the new sweet peas I
ordered."
</p>

<p>
I was not surprised at Annabel's sudden change of
subject.  I was accustomed to these alarms and
excursions in her improving conversation.  So I
obediently raised the nurseryman's bill close to my
short-sighted eyes.  But before I had time to examine it,
she began again: "It is very foolish of you to try your
eyes in that way, Reggie!  You really ought to wear
glasses."
</p>

<p>
"I dislike wearing glasses."
</p>

<p>
"That's neither here nor there&mdash;what you like or
dislike."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is, it's most decidedly here.  If&mdash;like
Cardinal Newman&mdash;'I do not ask to see the distant scene,'
why, my dear Annabel, should you intrude it upon
my notice?"
</p>

<p>
"It's simply vanity on your part; absurd vanity!
You are so proud of the Winterford eyes that you
don't like to hide them with glasses."
</p>

<p>
Annabel always talked of the Winterford eyes as
if they were the only genuine brand of human eyes
on the market, all other makes being but spurious
imitations.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't vanity at all," I remonstrated; "quite the
reverse.  I abstain from eyeglasses not for the sake
of my own good looks, but for the sake of the good
looks of others.  On the rare occasions when I do
wear spectacles, I find people so much plainer than
I have hitherto imagined them to be that Christian
charity compels me to pluck off the offending
super-members at once."
</p>

<p>
"And distant views," added Annabel; "think what
you miss in distant views."
</p>

<p>
"I miss nothing," I firmly replied, "that had better
not be missed.  The glorious blue haze of the distance
is mine, unmarred by the details that disfigure the
foreground for persons like yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I can tell the time by a clock three or four miles
off."
</p>

<p>
I shook my forefinger reprovingly.  "Annabel, don't
be boastful: remember boasting always goes before a
fall.  Moreover, what is the object of seeing the time
by a clock three or four miles off?  I'd much rather not
see it.  I like to gaze at abstract beauty untrammelled
by the temporary limitations of time and space."
</p>

<p>
"What age did he say they were?" asked Annabel
after a moment's pause, as if the incident of the
overcharged sweet peas had never interrupted our
conversation.
</p>

<p>
I wilfully misunderstood her.  "Time and space,
do you mean?  That, of course, depends upon the
date at which you compute the creation of the world.
According to certain authorities&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how silly you are!  You knew
perfectly well what I was talking about."
</p>

<p>
"What you were not talking about, you mean; yes,
of course I knew.  A lifelong experience has taught
me to follow unerringly the trapeze-like manoeuvres
of your acrobatic conversation.  Eighteen."
</p>

<p>
"Then they'll be leaving school soon."
</p>

<p>
"At once.  The boy for Oxford and the girl for
wherever girls go to when they grow up: Arcady, I
believe, is the name of the place.  But I, alas! have
never been in Arcady, nor you either, Annabel, worse
luck for us both!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell whether I've been there or not.  I've
travelled so much that I can't remember the names
of half the places I've been to.  I don't see how
anybody can, unless they make a rule of buying picture
post-cards at all the places where they stay.  I wish
I'd done this from the beginning, I went to so many
interesting places with dear papa.  But I don't think
picture post-cards were so much used then as they are
now."  Annabel was the type of woman who loves
to have a view of every hotel she stays at, and to
mark with a cross her own bedroom window.
</p>

<p>
"I should have thought valentines rather than postcards
would have supplied views of Arcady," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and isn't it rather interesting to see how as
picture post-cards have come in, valentines have gone
out?  I think it is so instructive to note little things
like that; they show the march of the times."  Annabel
always had a wonderful nose for instruction; she
scented it miles off&mdash;and in such strange places, too.
For her there was certainly no stone without its
sermon, and no running brook without its book.
</p>

<p>
"Arthur and I were saying last night that you would
have made a good Prime Minister or Archbishop
of Canterbury," I remarked, gazing at her thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"How ridiculous you two boys are!  Besides, I
never heard of a woman filling either of those
posts."  Annabel was nothing if not literal, and I found her
literalness very restful.
</p>

<p>
"A woman once became Pope of Rome," I said,
"somewhere in the Middle Ages.  At least there is a
legend to that effect."  I smiled and spoke most
benignly.  There is something very invigorating in being
regarded as a boy when one is over forty.
</p>

<p>
But Annabel shook her head.  "I could never have
been a Pope on principle; I so disapprove of Roman
Catholics.  At least if I had been I should have turned
Protestant."
</p>

<p>
"But you couldn't have done so at the time of which
am speaking.  Protestants weren't invented."
</p>

<p>
"Then I should have invented them," retorted the
intrepid Annabel.  And I felt sure that she would.
She was quite capable of it.
</p>

<p>
"And I really don't see how Arthur will be able
to manage them," she went on without a pause; "he
isn't at all cut out for that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
I resisted a temptation to ask why Arthur wasn't
cut out for the proper management of Protestants,
and replied: "He feels that himself; but he couldn't
very well refuse when Wildacre asked him, and seemed
so set on it, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Francis Wildacre was very attractive when he used
to come and stay here more than twenty years
ago," said Annabel.  "He had 'such a way with
him,' as Ponty used to say."  (Ponty was our old
nurse.)
</p>

<p>
"And such a way with you, too, in those days,"
I hastened to add.  "I used to think you were a little
in love with him."
</p>

<p>
Annabel owned the soft impeachment without a
blush: in spite of the fairness of her complexion, she
was not of the blushing order.  "I believe I was, in
a young and foolish sort of way."
</p>

<p>
"That is the only sort of way in which anybody
can be in love.  Love that isn't young and foolish in
its essence, is not love at all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, what nonsense!  The sensible mutual
attachment of older people is far more lasting."
</p>

<p>
"It may be lasting, but it isn't love.  The charm
of love is its divine folly."
</p>

<p>
"What a ridiculous idea!  Supposing my divine
folly, as you call it, had led me into marrying Francis
Wildacre, where should I have been now, I should
like to know?  A widow with two tiresome young
people to look after."
</p>

<p>
"But you are yearning to help Blathwayte to look
after them, so why shouldn't you have helped Wildacre
to look after them?  I don't see where the difference
comes in.  And, besides, they mightn't have been
there."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see any necessity to go into that," said
Annabel, doing the heavy sister to perfection.
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I.  But it was you who went into it, if
you remember, not I.  You dragged those young people
into the discussion, so to speak, by the hair of
their heads."
</p>

<p>
Annabel carried the war into the enemy's camp.
"And where should you have been if I had married
Francis Wildacre, I should like to know?" she asked
triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly where I am now.  There was no talk of
my marrying Wildacre."
</p>

<p>
"And all alone, with no one to look after you!"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, my dear Annabel, but you are confusing
dates.  I should have been all right now, because
you would be a widow, and would be living here
with me, and with a young niece and nephew to whom
I should be devoted.  Where I should have come
short would have been in the intervening twenty years
between your supposititious marriage with Wildacre
and the present time."
</p>

<p>
Like all typical elder sisters, Annabel loved to be
poked fun at by a younger brother.  That she never
saw the point of my feeble jokes in nowise lessened
her admiration of them; her faith in their excellence
was a perfect faith, being in truth the evidence of
things not seen.
</p>

<p>
"I think you'd have made a very nice uncle,
Reggie.  I've noticed that good brothers make good
uncles, just as good sons make good husbands.  I
think it is very interesting to notice little things like
that."
</p>

<p>
"And instructive," I added; "you've forgotten the
instructiveness."
</p>

<p>
"And instructive, too, of course.  All interesting
things are more or less instructive."
</p>

<p>
"But not invariably in the most elevating kinds of
knowledge," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"And besides being such a kind uncle, you'd have
had a very good personal influence on young
people."  Annabel was very keen on what she called "personal
influence"&mdash;a force which I myself consider is grossly
over-rated.  "For though you are sometimes very silly
on the surface, Reggie, you have plenty of good sound
sense underneath."
</p>

<p>
"You flatter me," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't; I never flatter people" (she never
did).  "But I think it encourages them to be told
their good points sometimes.  And now I come to
think of it, you will not be wasted as an uncle
altogether: you can behave as an uncle to these Wildacre
children after all."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; they will provide an admirable outlet
for my avuncular energies."  But I was pleased at the
idea all the same.  The role of an uncle had always
had its attractiveness for me; it possessed a good deal
of the charm of fatherhood with none of its soul-crushing
responsibility.  I felt I could never have
started a son in life; but I should have enjoyed to
take a nephew to the Zoo.  Therefore this suggestion
of Annabel's, that in the Wildacre children I should
find a ready-made niece and nephew, filled me with
distinct pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"I must go and see Cutler about them at once,"
said Annabel, rising from the breakfast-table (Cutler
was our gardener); "I'm sure they are not nearly as
advanced as they were this time last year."
</p>

<p>
"About what?  The Wildacres, do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"The forget-me-nots, of course.  How stupid you are!"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear girl, you have never mentioned the
forget-me-nots," I replied in self-defence.
</p>

<p>
"But I was thinking about them all the time.  They
seem to me very backward in that big bed on the
lawn; I am sure he has not planted them half thickly
enough.  It is very annoying, as I do so love a mass
of blue in contrast to the wallflowers.  I'm really
dreadfully disappointed about this bed, it is usually
so lovely, and extremely angry with Cutler.  I don't
know what to do about it.  What should you do,
Reggie?"
</p>

<p>
"I should knock Cutler down, and tell him that as
he has made his bed so he must lie on it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how ridiculous you are!  As if people
nowadays ever knocked their servants down as they
used to do when they were slaves!"
</p>

<p>
"I really think your distress is premature," I said
in a consoling voice; "it is early yet for forget-me-nots.
They'll be all right when they begin to flower.
The green sheet looks inadequate, I admit; but when
it puts on its blue counterpane, that bed will be a
dream."
</p>

<p>
But Annabel refused to be comforted.  "The plants
aren't sufficiently close together.  I'm going into the
garden to see about them at once, and that iniquitous
charge for sweet peas.  But that is the worst of leaving
bills so long unpaid, it tempts tradespeople to put
prices on."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not pay sooner?"
</p>

<p>
"I always pay at once&mdash;the minute the bills come
in.  Do you think papa's daughter could ever sleep
upon an unpaid bill?  It is the tradespeople who won't
send them in&mdash;just in order to run them up; but there
is no throwing dust in my eyes!  And if Arthur wants
a little womanly advice about how to deal with them,
especially the girl, he can always have it from
me, and you can tell him so the next time you see him."
</p>

<p>
And before I could frame a suitable reply to this
varied and voluminous remark, Annabel was out on
the lawn and making a bee-line for the inadequate
forget-me-nots.
</p>

<p>
As for myself, a sort of subconscious sex-sympathy
caused me to shrink from hearing Annabel deliver her
soul to Cutler with regard to these and the sweet
peas; so I wended my way upstairs to the nursery of
our childhood, where our old nurse, Ponting&mdash;called
by the other servants <i>Miss Ponting</i> and by Annabel
and me <i>Ponty</i>&mdash;still held sway, as she had done ever
since Annabel was a baby.
</p>

<p>
Ponty came from the Midlands, and was what is
known in her class of life as "a character."  She had
a great flow of language, unchecked by any pedantic
tendency to verify her quotations, and she boasted an
inexhaustible supply of legendary acquaintances, who
served as modern instances to point her morals and
adorn her tales.  She was a connoisseur in, or rather
a collector of, what she called "judgments," and
(according to Ponty) her native place&mdash;an obscure
village in the Midlands, Poppenhall by name&mdash;was a
modern Sodom and Gomorrah.  Possibly the inhabitants
of Poppenhall&mdash;like the eight upon whom the
tower of Siloam fell&mdash;were no worse than the majority
of their contemporaries; but (again according to
Ponty) they seemed to have been specially selected as
warnings and examples to the rest of the world.  For
instance, our childhood was enlivened by the story of
a boy at Poppenhall who swallowed a cherry-stone
which grew into a cherry-tree in his inside, until finally
the youth was choked by the cherries which clustered
in his throat: this was to prevent any swallowing of
cherry-stones on our part.  And there was an equally
improving legend of a Poppenhall girl who drank
water out of the village stream, and thereby
swallowed an eft which developed into an internal
monster, whose head was always popping in and out of her
mouth, thus spoiling both her conversation and her
appearance: this was to prevent any consumption by
my sister and myself of unfiltered and so unhallowed
water.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Master Reggie," began Ponty, as soon as I
entered the nursery (I was always Master Reggie to
Ponty, just as I was always a boy to Annabel), "this
is a piece of news I hear about the rector's adopting
two children!  It fairly took my breath away when
Miss Annabel told me about it."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it would," I answered, sitting down on
one of the comfortable chintz-covered chairs.
</p>

<p>
"It did; and I said to Miss Annabel, says I, 'No
good can come of it, a flying in the face of Providence
like that!'  I'm surprised at the rector, and him a
clergyman too," continued Ponty, as if the majority
of rectors were not in Holy Orders.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Ponty," I exclaimed, "you are carrying
matters a little too far.  I see no flying in the
face of Providence in the thing at all.  Quite the
contrary."
</p>

<p>
"That is all you know, Master Reggie; twisting
things about till you don't know whether you are
standing on your head or on your heels."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do know; neither at the present moment.
I have you there, Ponty."
</p>

<p>
But my feeble attempts at humour were as much
lost upon Ponty as they were upon Annabel.  "I call
it flying in the face of Providence to adopt children
when you haven't got any," she persisted; "if the
rector had been meant to have children he'd have had
them, without going and borrowing other folks'
leavings.  That's what I say.  I don't hold with adopting,
I never did.  Why, there was a woman at Poppenhall
when I was a girl, who went and adopted a boy because
she'd no children of her own, and when he grew up
he murdered her."
</p>

<p>
This was Ponty at her best.  I began to enjoy myself.
</p>

<p>
"This is interesting," I exclaimed; "but why did
he murder her?"
</p>

<p>
"A judgment on her, I suppose, for adopting him."
</p>

<p>
"A severe punishment for a kindly action," I
remarked.  "I hope the young Wildacres will not live to
murder Mr. Blathwayte."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I hope so too, but you never can tell with
strangers.  You don't know what's in them, as you
might say, like you do with those that you've had from
their birth."
</p>

<p>
"And even those give shocks sometimes to their
upbringers," I added, lighting a cigarette.  "I know you
don't mind my smoking, Ponty."
</p>

<p>
"Not for a moment, as far as I'm concerned, Master
Reggie; but for your own sake I doubt you smoke
too much.  I don't hold with making a chimney of
your throat, I never did, it's agen nature."
</p>

<p>
"But think of the relief to my overstrained nerves,
Ponty."
</p>

<p>
"Overstrained fiddlesticks, Master Reggie, if you'd
excuse my saying so!  Why, what have you got to
overstrain your nerves, I should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"There's trouble in the forget-me-not bed," I
answered solemnly.
</p>

<p>
Ponty's bright brown eyes twinkled.  She and I had
laughed together at Annabel ever since I could
remember.  "Oh, she's found it out, has she, Master
Reggie?  I knew there'd be trouble when I saw Cutler
planting them so far apart, but he wouldn't listen to
me.  The other servants are foolish not to take my
advice, for I knew Miss Annabel before some of them
were born or thought of.  She must have her own way,
and she must have it done in her own way, or there's
no peace for anybody."
</p>

<p>
"That being the case, you see my urgent need for
the soothing effects of tobacco."
</p>

<p>
But Ponty shook her head.  "I should try and get
soothed in some other way, if I was you, Master
Reggie: say with a peppermint drop or an Albert
biscuit.  Why, there was once a man at Poppenhall
when my father was a lad&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I knew there was," I murmured.  I felt that there
was a judgment impending, and I would not have
missed it for worlds.
</p>

<p>
"Who smoked and smoked till his throat was all
lined with soot, like a kitchen-chimney," continued
Ponty; "and one day a spark went down his throat
from his pipe and set fire to the soot, and he was
burned to death in a few minutes.  You see, the fire
being inside him, no one could get at it to put it out."
</p>

<p>
"How very shocking!  But why didn't the soot
choke him before he had time to get it on fire?  I
should have thought an accumulation of soot in the
throat was a most unwholesome thing, apart from the
danger of fire."
</p>

<p>
"It was a judgment upon him, that's all I can say,
and it isn't for us to dictate whether Providence shall
punish evildoers by choking or by burning."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," I replied.  "I am the last person
to take it upon myself to dictate to Providence."
</p>

<p>
"But smoking or no smoking, it's a fair treat to
see you and Miss Annabel at home again," said Ponty
with a most gracious smile; "for when all's said and
done the house don't seem like the house without you.
For my part, I don't hold with so much gadding about;
I never did; but you and Miss Annabel was always set
on having your own way, and I doubt always will be."
</p>

<p>
"Set on having Annabel's way, you mean," I amended.
</p>

<p>
"Just so, Master Reggie; from the time you were a
little boy Miss Annabel always made up your mind
for you, and I doubt if she'll ever get out of the habit
now.  But it's a pity!  For though I'm the last to
say a word against Miss Annabel, me having nursed
her ever since she was a month old, and the most
beautiful baby you ever saw, with a complexion like
wax, still she's a bit too wilful, and you and your poor
papa always having given way to her has made her
worse.  It doesn't do to be too self-willed."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not," I pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"No; more's the pity!  It would be a sight better
for Miss Annabel if you were.  I don't hold with folks
always getting their own way, especially women.  I
remember a well-to-do woman at Poppenhall when I
was a girl who was that set on marrying a particular
man as never was, and nothing else would do to
content her.  And they lived on at her house after they
were married, her being a woman of means.  He
caught the fever from drinking the water out of her
well, the well not having been cleaned out for years
and most unhealthy, and died just a month after their
wedding-day, which I hold was a judgment on her for
being so set on marrying that particular man."
</p>

<p>
"But any other man might have got the fever from
the insanitary well," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"But no other man ever did.  Which is a lesson
to us all not to be too set on having our own way,
nor to let other people be too set either.  I doubt
that trouble will come some day from your being so
under the thumb of Miss Annabel; I do indeed; and
I'm sure I'm sorry in my heart for Cutler when the
things in the garden don't come exactly as she meant
them to."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry for him, too," I added.  And I really was.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't hold with folks as have beautiful
houses spending half their time away from them.  It
isn't right to leave fine houses and beautiful furniture
with only a lot of ignorant young housemaids to keep
them all clean.  It's agen nature.  Of course I see
after them to the best of my power, but I'm not what
I was, and they are more so.  I remember a gentleman
living near Poppenhall, when my father was a
lad, who was always leaving his beautiful house with
only servants to look after it, and spending months
and months in foreign parts, and the consequence was
that once when he was away the house was struck by
lightning!"
</p>

<p>
"But I don't see what the difference his absence
could make to the lightning," I ventured to suggest.
</p>

<p>
But Ponty would have none of my casuistry.  "It
made all the difference, Master Reggie; for the house
was never struck as long as he was at home.  It was
just a judgment upon him for leaving it."
</p>

<p>
That was the charm of Ponty: she could always
wriggle with grace and dignity out of her own
statements.  Had she only been a man this gift would
assuredly have raised her to eminence in Parliament,
and would have made her a shining ornament of any
Ministry.
</p>

<p>
After a little more improving conversation with my
old nurse I strolled downstairs and out of doors, where
I found Annabel talking to a chastened Cutler by the
forget-me-not bed.
</p>

<p>
"Come for a stroll round the garden," I said, slipping
my arm into hers, "and let us see if the vine has
flourished and the pomegranates have budded, as they
did in the Song of Solomon."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how we can do that," replied Annabel,
"considering that it is too early for grapes, and we
have no pomegranates.  As a matter of fact, I don't
believe pomegranates ever do grow in England.  Do
you know whether they do?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't, and I don't want to.  I only know
that vines and pomegranates and all the other glorious
things of the Song of Songs seem to be in the air when
spring begins.  It is a Song of Spring."
</p>

<p>
"It always seems to me a very peculiar sort of song,"
remarked Annabel; "and I don't understand it and
don't pretend to.  I remember Uncle William once
expounding it at prayers for the sake of the servants,
but I doubt if they were much the wiser for his
exposition.  I know I wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> should have been," I exclaimed fervently.  "It
must have been a liberal education to hear him.  And
to think that it was wasted upon you and the servants,
when I&mdash;who alone could have appreciated it&mdash;was
not there!"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't only me and the servants: papa was there
and Aunt Maria, and there were several people staying
in the house."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Ponty has delivered herself of a simply
priceless judgment to-day," I said, and proceeded
to retail to my sister the story of the man whose house
was struck by lightning because he left it too much to
servants.
</p>

<p>
Annabel laughed heartily.  Then, after a moment's
pause, she said: "But all the same, Reggie, I don't
quite see what difference his being at home would have
made."
</p>

<p>
I stood still in the garden path, and regarded my
sister with profound admiration not unmixed with
wonder.  "Annabel," I exclaimed, "in your own
particular way you are almost as priceless as Ponty!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
FRANK
</h3>

<p>
One afternoon a few days after the foregoing
conversations, when Annabel and I were seated round
(as far as it is in the power of two persons to sit round
anything) the old gate-legged table in the hall at the
Manor, having our respective teas, the door-bell
clanged, and the butler in due sequence ushered into
our midst Arthur Blathwayte and another&mdash;which
other was destined to play an important part in the
dawning drama of my life.
</p>

<p>
I will try to describe him, though to my mind the
Wildacres always beggared description: they were so
utterly unlike everybody else that there were no known
standards by which to measure them.  On that April
afternoon when he first crossed my path, Frank Wildacre
was eighteen, and looked both more and less.  He
was by no means tall, but so slenderly built that he
seemed taller than he really was until one compared
him with other men, and this smallness and slightness
added to the boyishness of his appearance.  His face
was neither old nor young&mdash;or, rather, it was both.
It possessed somehow the youthfulness of dawn and
of springtime, and of all those things which have
retained their undimmed youth through the march of
the centuries.  It was not so much that Frank Wildacre
was young; everybody has been young at some time or
another, and has got over it sooner or later: it was
rather that he was youth itself.
</p>

<p>
I could not tell when first I saw him whether his
face was beautiful or not: I cannot tell now; I only
knew that it was wonderful, strange, glorious, unlike
any other face in the world&mdash;save one: and that one
I had not yet seen.
</p>

<p>
I perceived that his hair was dark and curly, and
that his eyes were of that deep and mysterious grey
which sometimes looks blue and sometimes black: also
that he had that pale delicacy of skin and complexion
which makes other people appear coarse and clumsy
by contrast.  Thus far even my short-sighted eyes
could carry me.  But it was not by their aid that I
became conscious of that strange and subtle gift,
possessed to such an extreme degree by Wildacre and his
children, which for want of a better name men call
charm.  It was elusive, it was bewitching, it was
indescribable; but all the same it was <i>there</i>.
</p>

<p>
It was not the usual human charm of ordinary
attractive people.  It was something far more magical
and spell-weaving than that.  In fact it was so
unusual that there was almost something uncanny about
it.  It was the charm of fairies and of elves rather
than of "golden boys and girls": it was a spell woven
out of moonbeams and will-o'-the-wisp rather than
out of breezes and the sunshine of a soft spring day.
I never met any one with that peculiar kind of charm
save Wildacre and his son and daughter, and his
children&mdash;more especially the daughter&mdash;had it to a
far greater extent than he.  But it was that
strange fascination of Wildacre's that induced Blathwayte
to upset his whole scheme of existence in order
to gratify Wildacre's whim, and it was that same
attribute intensified in the twins that turned my
world upside down and reduced its orderly routine to
chaos.
</p>

<p>
Big, ugly Arthur&mdash;looking bigger and uglier than
usual beside the ethereal boy&mdash;shook hands with us,
and introduced his guest, and in a few moments the
fairy changeling was sitting at the gate-legged table
with us three ordinary mortals, drinking tea like any
English schoolboy.  But he was not like an English
schoolboy in any other respect.
</p>

<p>
He was perfectly at ease with us at once, as indeed
he was with everybody.  There was no such word as
<i>shyness</i> in Frank Wildacre's dictionary.  But the
funny thing was that&mdash;quite unconsciously to
himself&mdash;he seemed to be bestowing a favour upon Annabel
and me in condescending to drink tea with us, while
(if the truth must be told) Annabel and I generally
considered it rather an act of graciousness on our part
to invite any one to tea at Restham Manor.  I think
it must have been the Winterford blood bubbling in
our veins that produced this exclusive and archaic
feeling, or it might have been merely a symptom of the
general grooviness of single middle age.
</p>

<p>
Frank was delighted with Restham, and hastened
to tell us so, thereby grappling Annabel to his soul
with hoops of steel.  Blathwayte had already told him
the history and legends of the place; and he had
assimilated these as if he had known them for years.
And he not only assimilated them: he seemed to give
them back again to us so enriched with the decoration
of his fancy that we&mdash;who had been brought up on
them&mdash;realised for the first time how beautiful they
were.
</p>

<p>
"So Mr. Blathwayte has told you that we are situated
on the Pilgrim's Road," said Annabel, after the
conversation had flowed for some minutes like a river
in spate.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he has," replied the boy, his delicate
face aglow; "and that is one of the things that has
made Restham so awfully interesting.  But what makes
it even more thrilling to me is that the road was a
Roman road too, and so was trodden by Cæsar's
legions before such things as pilgrims were ever
invented.  Do you know, Miss Kingsnorth, I'm not
tremendously keen on pilgrims myself?  They seem to
have made themselves so unnecessarily uncomfortable,
with peas in their shoes, and hair-shirts, and things
of that kind.  And they were so dirty, too, and seemed
to think there was some sort of virtue in not having
a bath when they needed one."
</p>

<p>
"And they were Papists also," added Annabel.
</p>

<p>
Frank, however, treated this fault with considerable
leniency.  "I don't mind so much about that; you see
you had to be a Papist in those days or else a heathen;
and though I am nuts on heathens myself, I
know that lots of people don't approve of them.  Of
course I don't care for the modern sort of common or
garden heathens, who wear black skins instead of
clothes, and are the stock-in-trade of missionaries.
What I like are the dear old Greek and Roman
heathens, who worshipped the gods and the heroes, and
who had groves instead of churches, and vestal virgins
instead of nuns."
</p>

<p>
To my surprise Annabel was not at all shocked by
this, as she ought to have been.  But you never can
tell what will shock or will not shock a thoroughly
nice-minded woman.  "I am glad you do not approve of
nuns," was all she said, and she said it quite amiably.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't bear them," replied Frank; "their
dresses are so hideous&mdash;just like mummy-costumes;
and pilgrims, you know, were all more or less on the
same lines&mdash;trying to make themselves as ugly and
as uncomfortable as possible.  I'll bet you anything
that when they came to the top of Restham Hill they
were looking down and counting their beads instead
of revelling in the view of the weald and the wind
over the downs, and all the rest of the open-air
jolliness."
</p>

<p>
Here Blathwayte gently interposed.  "I think, my
dear boy, that you are rather mixing up the Greek
and the Roman periods.  Remember they were two
distinct civilizations."
</p>

<p>
"But the principle was the same," retorted Frank
airily; "gods and goddesses and marble temples, instead
of priests and pilgrims and stuffy churches.  No,
Miss Kingsnorth," he added, flashing his brilliant
smile on Annabel, as if it had been a searchlight, "none
of your mediæval pilgrims on the Canterbury Road
for me, but rather the Roman Johnnies making a
bee-line for London, with the adventures of a new
country shouting to them to come on.  Of course
they'd think that if the England south of Restham
was so jolly, the England north of Restham would
be ten times jollier, because the things in front always
seem so much nicer than the things behind, don't you
know!"
</p>

<p>
"Only when you are young," I remarked.  "I believe
it was merely the young Roman legionaries who
felt like that.  I expect the older ones longed to stay
in the pleasant Kentish county for fear that by going
further they would eventually fare worse."
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed gaily.  "No, no, Sir Reginald,
they weren't so stuffy as all that!  They were out
on an adventure, you see, and the adventure-spirit
turned everything into a picnic.  Therefore when I
climb up Restham Hill I like to feel the Roman
legions marching beside me, with all the fun of a new
World in front of them.  They shall be my ghostly
companions rather than the stodgy old pilgrims
who looked down at their beads and limped on their
peas."
</p>

<p>
"But the pilgrims were adventurous too," I argued.
"Remember there are adventures of the soul as well
as of the body, and to my mind the tramp of the
paid legionaries, marching stolidly up the hill in the
wake of the Roman eagles, was nothing like so
thrilling an adventure as the descent of the same hill
by the bands of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury.
The Roman soldier had no individual interests: he
was part of a huge system or machine.  It mattered
little to him personally whether the particular eagle
which he followed hovered over Britain or over Gaul."
</p>

<p>
Here Arthur interrupted me.  "The pilgrim was
part of a huge system also, only his system was not
called an Empire, but a Church."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," I answered; "and there is where the
greater adventurousness of the pilgrim comes in; for
it is far more exciting to belong to a Church than to
an Empire."
</p>

<p>
"My hat!" exclaimed the irrepressible boy; "if a
fellow will say that he'll say anything!"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>will</i> say anything," I replied, "often I do,
provided, of course, that anything is true."
</p>

<p>
"Or that you think it true," amended Arthur.
</p>

<p>
"Which comes to the same thing, as far as I am
concerned," I added.
</p>

<p>
"I do not agree with you in that," said Annabel;
"thinking things are so, doesn't make them so."
</p>

<p>
"Morally speaking it does," I argued.  "If I think
it is wrong to eat meat on a Friday, it is wrong of
me to eat it; and if I think it is wrong to play games
on a Sunday, it is wrong of me to play them."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," retorted Annabel; "the cases are
absolutely different.  It <i>is</i> wrong to play games on a
Sunday, and would be just as wrong for you as for
anybody else.  But as to there being anything wrong
in eating meat on a Friday, the idea is absolutely
absurd, and nothing that you could think about it would
make it an atom less ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
"Annabel, you are simply priceless!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I see no pricelessness in that," replied my sister;
"I'm only talking common sense."
</p>

<p>
"Not common, Annabel; far from common; sense
as rare as it is priceless!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how silly you are!  Isn't he absurd,
Mr. Wildacre?"
</p>

<p>
"Please don't call me Mr. Wildacre, it makes me
feel a hundred, and an enemy at that.  Call me Frank,
and in return I'll call Sir Reginald any name you like.
And now, Sir Reginald, please tell us why you think
your pilgrims had more fun in the long run than my
legions?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply because their run was so much longer, and
so could hold so much more.  You admit that the
adventure of the legions consisted in their anticipations
of seeing and possessing a new country; but I
maintain that the adventure on which the pilgrims
had embarked included not only a new country, but
a new heaven and a new earth.  The Pilgrims' Way
was not merely the way to Canterbury: it was the
way, via Canterbury, to the New Jerusalem."
</p>

<p>
The mocking grey eyes suddenly grew thoughtful.
"I see what you are driving at, Sir Reginald.  You
are thinking of all that the pilgrimage stood for rather
than of just the pilgrimage itself."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am.  And to find the true value of
anything, you must think of all that it stands for
rather than of the thing itself.  The Crown of England
means more than the bejewelled head-gear which is
kept in a glass case in the Tower; the colours of a
regiment are not valued at the rate of so much per
yard of tattered silk; and a wedding-ring means far
more to a woman than an ounce or so of twenty-two
carat gold."
</p>

<p>
"Are wedding-rings made of twenty-two carat
gold?" asked Annabel in her unquenchable thirst for
information; "I thought eighteen carat was the purest
gold ever used."
</p>

<p>
"So it is for ordinary jewellery," explained Arthur;
"but wedding-rings, I have always heard, are made
of twenty-two carat.  At least that is what is
generally believed; but I cannot say whether it is more
than a tradition, like the idea that the sun will put a
fire out."
</p>

<p>
"But is that only a tradition?" Annabel asked.  "I
always pull the blinds down when the sunshine falls
on the fire, for fear of putting it out."
</p>

<p>
"For fear of putting which out," I inquired, "the
sunshine or the fire?"
</p>

<p>
"The fire, of course.  How could anything put the
sunshine out, Reggie?  How silly you are!"
</p>

<p>
"It is pure superstition," answered Blathwayte,
who found it as blessed to give information as did my
sister to receive it; "a fire naturally by force of
contrast looks less brilliant in the sunlight than in the
shade, but the sunlight has no actual effect on it
whatsoever."
</p>

<p>
At this juncture I happened to catch Frank's eye,
and to my delight perceived that the humour of the
situation struck him as it struck me.  Of course I
knew how funny it was of Annabel and Arthur to take
hold of all the romance of life, and transmute it&mdash;by
some strange alchemy of their own&mdash;into useful
and intelligent information; I had seen them at it for
years and years, and had never failed to enjoy the
sight; but it was very clever of Frank, who had known
Arthur for two months and Annabel for twenty
minutes, to see that it was funny also.
</p>

<p>
"My last question was not so silly after all," I
remarked.  "I think the sunshine of life is frequently
extinguished by a too great absorption in the cares of
the domestic hearth.  See, for instance, those numerous
cases where the energy of the spring-fever expends
itself upon the exigencies of the spring-cleaning."
</p>

<p>
"I hate a spring-cleaning," exclaimed Frank: "it
always means that everything is put back into
something else's place, and you can never find anything
you want till you've left off wanting it."
</p>

<p>
"But you find all the things you wanted the spring
before last," I added, "and have now forgotten that
you ever possessed, and have no longer any use for."
</p>

<p>
"And all your books seem to have played General
Post," continued Frank; "Volume One has changed
places with Volume Six, and the dictionary is where
the Bible ought to be, and the cookery book is among
the poems."
</p>

<p>
"I never keep a Bible in a bookcase," remarked
Annabel; "it somehow doesn't seem reverent to do so."
</p>

<p>
I could not let this pass.  "Yes, you do: you keep
one in that bookcase in your bedroom.  I've seen it
there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! a bookcase in a bedroom is quite a different
thing from an ordinary library bookcase, Reggie; in
fact I never keep any but religious books in my
bedroom bookcase.  One doesn't, somehow."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot see," I argued, "why a hanging
bookcase in a bedroom&mdash;forming, mark you, a companion
ornament to the medicine-chest on the other side of
the wardrobe&mdash;is a more reverent resting-place for a
Bible than is the shelf of a well-stocked library.  Why
should clothes and drugs exhale a more holy atmosphere
than secular literature?"
</p>

<p>
But no arguments ever shook Annabel.  "I can't
explain why it's different, but it is different, Reggie;
and if you don't see it, you ought to.  And I'm sure
the sun does put it out, Arthur, because I've seen it
do it."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Arthur proceeded to expound at some
length the reason why it was scientifically impossible
for sunlight to put out firelight; whilst Frank and I
took the opportunity of stepping out-of-doors into the
garden.
</p>

<p>
"I see what you mean about things being so much
more than they actually are, Sir Reginald," began
the boy as soon as we were out of earshot of the effects&mdash;or
rather the non-effects&mdash;of sun upon fire; "it never
struck me quite like that before, but it makes everything
most awfully interesting when you look at it in
that way."
</p>

<p>
"I know it does.  And it is not only the most
interesting way&mdash;it is also the truest way&mdash;of
looking at things.  You see, when you realise how
much is involved in even the smallest happenings&mdash;how
much romance and excitement and general
thrilliness&mdash;it turns everything into the most glorious
adventure."
</p>

<p>
Frank nodded his approval of these sentiments.  "I
know, and adventures are such splendid things, aren't
they?  But I say, it's most awfully decent of you to
have ideas like this, and to be so keen on adventures
and things of that kind!"
</p>

<p>
"At my age, you mean?" I added, with a smile;
but I cannot affirm that the smile was untainted by
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Frank nodded again.  "You might be the same age
as Fay and me, to hear you talk," he replied, with
more graciousness than grammar.  "I'll tell you what:
Fay will like you most awfully.  She is tremendously
keen on people who have queer ideas and talk about
feelings and things of that kind.  She hates ordinary
sort of talk about clothes and the weather and other
people's servants, and she positively loathes
information, or anything at all instructive."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am afraid she and my sister will not have
much in common," I said, little dreaming that, like
Micaiah the son of Imlah, I was prophesying evil
concerning me.
</p>

<p>
"Not they!  Fay'll have no use for Miss Kingsnorth,
and not much for old Blathwayte.  They'll be
altogether too improving for her.  But she'll take to
you most tremendously, you bet!"
</p>

<p>
I was elated at this.  The approval of one's juniors
is apt to go to one's head like wine.  But at the same
time I felt a certain disloyalty in being uplifted at
Annabel's expense.  "Fay will find my sister a very
kind friend as well as a very competent one," I replied
rather stiffly.
</p>

<p>
But my stiffness was wasted on the desert air.
"Oh, I'm sure Miss Kingsnorth is awfully kind," said
Frank airily, "and so is old Blathwayte, if you come
to that.  But they aren't a bit Fay's sort.  Just as
really they aren't your sort, if they weren't your sister
and your rector.  Of course one would like one's
sister, whatever she was; I should be fond of Fay, even
if she was like Miss Kingsnorth; but she wouldn't
be my sort, do you see?  In the same way Fay and I
would have been fond of Father whatever he'd have
been like, just because he was our father.  But he
happened to be our sort as well, so we simply adored
him."
</p>

<p>
This slightly took my breath away.  I had not yet
been broken in to the custom of the rising generation
of discussing their elders as freely as they discuss
their contemporaries.  The ancient tradition of ordering
myself lowly and reverently before my betters still
tainted my blood, and I had not outworn the Victorian
creed that one's elders are of necessity one's betters.
</p>

<p>
"It would never have occurred to me to consider
whether my parents were my sort or not," I said.
</p>

<p>
"It would to me&mdash;the very first thing.  You see,
some families are all the same sort, like a set of
tea-things, while others are just a scratch team.  We were
all the same sort&mdash;Father and Fay and me.  But you
and Miss Kingsnorth are not the same pattern, nor
the same make, nor even the same material.  You are
pure scratch."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.  Though I was devoted to Annabel, I did
not exactly yearn to be considered like her.  "Then
do you honour me by considering me your sort as well
as your sister's?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the same thing: Fay's sort is always my sort.
We're as much alike inside as we are out, and we
always feel the same about things and people.  It's
most awfully lucky for us," continued the boy, slipping
his arm into mine in a delightfully confidential
fashion as we strolled up and down the lawn, "that
you happen to be our sort, as it would have been
rather rough luck on Fay and me to have nobody
better to talk to than old Blathwayte.  But now that
you are so decent we shall manage quite well."
</p>

<p>
Had I possessed any aptitude for the word in
season, I should have here endeavoured to rub in some
salutary suggestions as to poor Arthur's kindness in
throwing open his celibate rectory to two homeless
orphans; but the improvement of other people has
never been one of my foibles.  "It will make it much
jollier for me, too, to have you and your sister to
talk to," was all I said.
</p>

<p>
"I liked that idea of yours about the pilgrims most
awfully," continued Frank, with the glorious patronage
of youth; "it is so jolly to think of their being
on an adventure as well as the Roman legions."
</p>

<p>
"And starting in a much more adventurous spirit,
because a so much more imaginative one.  For my
part I don't believe the tramping soldiers saw much
further than their own Roman noses, while the
pilgrims beheld visions of the earthly Jerusalem as they
made the Holy Sign upon the holy stone from Palestine,
and visions of the heavenly Jerusalem as they
approached the towers of Canterbury."
</p>

<p>
"And what makes it so much more interesting to
us, when you come to think of it, is that the Roman
adventure came to an end ages and ages ago," added
Frank; "while the pilgrims' adventure is still going
on, and we're sort of part of it&mdash;at least we can be
if we like."
</p>

<p>
I could have shouted aloud for joy to have chanced
upon so kindred a spirit.  "Exactly so," I answered;
"my dear boy, you have grasped the idea of what it
means to belong to an historic Church: it is the idea
of being all part of the one great adventure."
</p>

<p>
"I know; just like things that have happened to
one's own ancestry are so much more thrilling than
things which happened to other people's, because
they're all in the family, don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
By this time Blathwayte had apparently succeeded
in convincing Annabel that the sun could not put a
fire out&mdash;or else Annabel had succeeded in convincing
him that a fire could put the sun out&mdash;I have never
yet discovered which; but any way the argument had
arrived at a satisfactory conclusion, and the
combatants came into the garden together in perfect amity,
whereupon Annabel carried off Frank to show him the
unworthy forget-me-nots, and consult him as to her
dealings with them, whilst Arthur discussed with me
the course of proceedings of the coming Easter vestry.
Some men have greatness thrust upon them, and the
greatness of being rector's warden of Restham parish
had been thrust upon me by Blathwayte some years
previously.
</p>

<p>
Thus began my friendship with Frank Wildacre&mdash;a
friendship which was destined to bring sorrow as
well as joy into my life.  Do I wish that I had never
known him, and so had escaped all the pain that he
was foredoomed to cause me?  I cannot say.  Life
would doubtless have been far easier for me had he
never crossed my path.  But on the other hand he
was part of the great adventure on which I embarked
when I forsook my backwater, and I still feel for
him&mdash;after all that has happened&mdash;that sense of comradeship
which the sharing of an adventure always leaves
behind it after the battles and the bitterness are over
and done with.
</p>

<p>
I think that is the reason why&mdash;as one grows older&mdash;one
feels an interest in people one knew when one
was young, even if one felt no interest in them at the
time.  They were part of the great adventure of one's
youth.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
FAY
</h3>

<p>
The intimacy between Frank Wildacre and myself
developed apace.  We discussed everything from
Shakespeare to the musical glasses (whatever that
may mean), and found ourselves wonderfully agreed
on most points.  On the few points where we did not
see eye to eye, our differences were as pleasant as our
agreements, for Frank loved argument for argument's
sake, and never came within a mile of losing his temper.
In my humble opinion people who lose their tempers
over arguments are as tiresome as people who lose
their tempers over games, and both should respectively
be talked to and played with at the expense of the
State rather than of Society.
</p>

<p>
Frank not only firmly established himself in my
affections: he made equally secure resting-places in
the affections of Annabel and Arthur, and even of
Ponty.  But&mdash;so weak was I&mdash;it flattered my vanity
to perceive that in his eyes I found the most favour
of the four.  It was so delightful to feel myself in
touch with youth, and to know that youth was not
altogether out of touch with me.  The angel of youth
stirred the pool of my backwater, and rippled the
stagnant surface with the breath of healing.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have taken to Frank," Annabel remarked.
"I am glad, as it will be so nice for him to
have a friend like you."
</p>

<p>
"I should rather put it that it will be nice for me
to have a friend like him."  Already a week's
intimacy with young Wildacre had shaken my hitherto
unquestioning acceptance of the dogma that one's
elders are of necessity one's betters; but nothing would
ever shake Annabel's.
</p>

<p>
"That is an absurd way of looking at it, Reggie.
Young people may be rather a nuisance to us, but we
must always be a help and comfort to them, and
especially when&mdash;as in Frank's case&mdash;they have no parents
of their own.  You will try to prove next that even
parents are no help to the young!"
</p>

<p>
"Far from it!  I would ever go so far as to urge
that they are more than a help&mdash;that they amount to
a necessity.  I quite agree that children can&mdash;and
ought to&mdash;learn much from their parents; but the
relation of a parent is unique.  Because children must
submit to their parents, it doesn't follow that they
must submit to all their elders."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it does, because it would be impossible for
the parents not to be older than the children," replied
Annabel triumphantly, "so that the one includes the
other."
</p>

<p>
I marvelled at the reasoning powers of the female
mind, and held my peace.  Feeling that her logic had
utterly confounded me, Annabel condescended to be
gracious.  "Still, of course, it is pleasant for you to
have Frank as a companion," she deigned to admit.
"He takes the place of that nephew which I always
regret you never had."
</p>

<p>
"The remedy was in your own hands," I ventured
to remark.
</p>

<p>
"Reggie, don't be coarse!  I think the relation of
uncles and aunts is a very agreeable one, as it
provides all the pleasure of being a parent with none of
the responsibility: at least, none of the overpowering
responsibilities.  Now if you'd had children, they
would have been a source of great interest and
pleasure to me."
</p>

<p>
"Who is being coarse now?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not I; and it isn't very nice-minded of
you to suggest such a thing.  To the pure all things
are pure."
</p>

<p>
I had never for a moment doubted Annabel's purity,
so I humbly ceded the point.  "I wonder if you
would have been an equal source of interest and
pleasure to them," I speculated.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I should.  I should have been a second
mother to them," replied Annabel briskly, without,
however, lifting the veil, which evidently, in her
imagination, shrouded the fate of their first mother, and
prevented the latter from fulfilling her appointed
maternal duties.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was in particularly good spirits just then.
Easter Day had passed without developing in Arthur
any symptoms of blatant ritualism: the forget-me-nots
were flourishing with such vigour that the blue blush,
which was just beginning to tint their surface,
promised to spread over the whole bed, and the results of
the spring-cleaning, which had been conducted during
our absence abroad, appeared to be more than usually
drastic and complete.  Therefore my sister's cup of
happiness was inclined to brim over.
</p>

<p>
As for myself, I was impatient, I admit, for the
coming of Miss Wildacre.  As I was generally talking
to Frank, and as Frank was generally talking about
his sister, that sister necessarily was often in my
thoughts, and I was extremely curious to see what
manner of girl she would prove to be.
</p>

<p>
"When is your sister coming?" I asked him one
day.  "I thought you had left school this last term,
and were coming to settle down at Restham for the
summer: you on your way to Oxford in October,
and your sister more or less for what people call
'good.'"
</p>

<p>
"So we are.  Fay has left school as school; but
she is so awfully keen on her old schoolmistresses that
she is spending her last Easter with them just for
pleasure, after all the other girls have gone home for
the holidays, except one that has only a father and
mother in India, and an aunt who is too full just now
to take her in."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder at Miss Fay being so fond of her
school-mistresses, as you told me she hated anything in the
shape of improvement or instruction."
</p>

<p>
"So she does.  But the Miss Wylies never improved
her at all: she is just as nice now as she was when
she first went there.  And as for teaching her anything,
they simply couldn't, for she knew a sight more
when she was a kid of ten than they know now."
</p>

<p>
"A most harmless seminary," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"But she is coming at the end of this week," Frank
continued; "she says she can't keep away any longer,
she is in such a tremendous hurry to see you, after
all I've told her about you."
</p>

<p>
"What have you told her about me?" I asked,
with pardonable curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, lots and lots of things!  I've told her how
good looking you are in a queer, Charles the First kind
of way, and how you resemble the Miss Wylies in
being so young for your age, and not seeming anything
like as old as you really are, and how you like
the things we like, and laugh at the things we laugh at."
</p>

<p>
"A fairly accurate description, but not altogether
a complimentary one," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyhow&mdash;complimentary or not complimentary&mdash;it's
made her wild to see you, and I'm sure
that ought to satisfy a fellow."
</p>

<p>
"It does," I replied; "but the important question
is, shall I satisfy Miss Wildacre when she comes here
expecting a combination of Charles the First and the
Miss Wylies and herself and yourself rolled into one?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she'll be satisfied right enough; trust her!
I will say that for Fay: she's very easily pleased."
</p>

<p>
"In that case she and I are bound to get on well
together," I said, stroking my moustache in order to
hide a smile.
</p>

<p>
On the Saturday afternoon before Low Sunday I
was sitting smoking on the lawn.  It was one of those
precocious spring days which give themselves the airs
of the height of summer, and I treated it as if it were
really summer, and behaved myself accordingly.
Not so Annabel.  She regulated her conduct by the
almanac rather than the atmosphere, and never
considered it safe to sit out-of-doors until May was
overpast.  Let the sun beat down never so fiercely
upon her covered head, Annabel stood upon her feet
as long as she was out-of-doors.  Why it was warmer
to stand still than to sit still, I never was able to make
out; but Annabel considered that it was, and
therefore to her it was so.  But when once the calendar
assured her that "May was out" and that consequently
she would be justified in casting as many
clouts as she desired, the conduct as well as the
costume of my sister underwent a complete transformation.
She would then sit out-of-doors in a linen
gown, defying the inclemency of an English June for
hours together, whilst the fire-places at the Manor
became suddenly clad with such a superabundance of
verdure that the lighting of a fire would have been a
veritable upheaval of Nature.
</p>

<p>
On this particular Saturday afternoon, the
thermometer being sixty-three in the shade, Annabel was
keeping herself warm by standing perfectly still
watching Cutler ply the mowing-machine, whilst I
was keeping myself equally cool by sitting on the
terrace doing nothing in particular, when suddenly
the big oak door which led into the village opened,
and Frank Wildacre, with a girl in deep mourning,
came down the stone steps into the garden.
</p>

<p>
As long as I live I shall never forget the vision of
Fay Wildacre as she stepped into my life that sunny
afternoon.  Although, according to Annabel, the time
for clout-casting was still more than a month ahead,
the girl's dress had no memory of winter clinging to
it: it was of a diaphanous texture, falling in soft folds
round her slight figure, and the neck and arms of it
were transparent, showing the dazzlingly fair skin
underneath.  On her head was a big black hat, which
threw her curly hair and her starry eyes into most
becoming shadow, making them look darker than they
really were.  She was certainly very like Frank,
though rather taller for a woman than he was for a
man, and she shared his elfin grace and vitality, and
his transparent white complexion and bright scarlet
lips.  She was a replica of her brother, only more
fairy-like.  Perhaps my short-sightedness, which hid
any defects she might have had, caused me then, as
afterwards, to exaggerate her beauty.  Of that I am
unable to judge.  But all I know is that as Fay
Wildacre stood before me that afternoon, she appeared the
embodiment of everything that is exquisite and enchanting
and elusive in womankind: I had never seen&mdash;I
had never even imagined&mdash;anything quite so entrancing.
</p>

<p>
And that was the girl towards whom Annabel had
decreed that I should play the part of an affectionate
uncle!
</p>

<p>
"This is Fay," was Frank's succinct introduction
as we met in the middle of the lawn.  "Now isn't he
just what I told you?" he added, turning to his sister.
</p>

<p>
For a second a cool little hand lay in my own, and
a pair of glorious grey eyes looked laughingly into
mine, while a deep, almost boyish, voice replied:
"Quite a look of Charles the First, and distinct dash
of us but not the faintest flavour of Wylie."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I rejoined, "you have relieved my
mind considerably."
</p>

<p>
Fay laughed Frank's merry gurgle.  "It really was
hard lines on you to be told you were Wylie-ish, and
so untrue, too!  Frankie, how could you be such a
brute to the poor man?"
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't the least bit of a brute.  I only meant
he was like the Wylies in not looking or seeming his
age.  And, besides, you're always so keen on the
Wylies that I thought you'd think it a compliment for
anybody to be thought like them."
</p>

<p>
The mocking eyes were now turned upon Frank.
"But no one is attached to many people whom one
would hate to resemble.  I adore the Wylies myself;
but if you said I was like them I should knock you
down."
</p>

<p>
Frank grinned.  "If you could."
</p>

<p>
"I could&mdash;easily.  I am quite as tall as you are
and much stronger," retorted the redoubtable Miss
Wildacre.
</p>

<p>
"And I am quite ready to keep the ring," I added.
</p>

<p>
Fay shook her head.  "No, Sir Reginald; as I am
strong I will be merciful, especially as I have put my
best frock on in order to produce a favourable
impression on you and Miss Kingsnorth.  I'm not dressed
for prize-fighting."
</p>

<p>
"As regards myself, the frock has succeeded beyond
your wildest expectations.  I cannot, of course,
answer for my sister; but here she comes to answer
for herself," I replied, as Annabel joined us.
"Annabel, let me introduce you to Miss Wildacre."
</p>

<p>
"I am very pleased to see you, my dear, and to
welcome you to Restham," said my sister in her most
gracious manner.  "I very much hope that you will
like the place and be happy here."
</p>

<p>
"Of course she will," Frank chimed in; "because
I do: Fay and I invariably like the same things."
</p>

<p>
"I trust that Miss Wildacre will endorse your good
opinion," said Annabel.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please don't call me Miss Wildacre.  If you
do I shall get home-sick at once; and that would be
a pity, as I've no home to go to to cure it.  If I'm
to be happy, everybody must call me Fay: otherwise
I shall wrap myself in a green-and-yellow melancholy,
and sit, like Patience on a monument, smiling at
Restham."
</p>

<p>
Annabel beamed at this suggestion.  "I certainly
think it will sound more friendly for me to call you
by your Christian name, and for Reginald to do so
too.  It seems rather absurd for people of our age
to call children of yours <i>Mr</i>. and <i>Miss</i>.  Besides, we
want to take the place of an uncle and an aunt to
you, and uncles and aunts always call nephews and
nieces by their Christian names."
</p>

<p>
I felt a distinct wave of irritation against Annabel.
I was fully aware that I was twenty-four years older
than the twins, but I saw no necessity for rubbing it
in like this, and, after all, I was five years younger
than Annabel.
</p>

<p>
After a little desultory conversation, my sister
asked the young people to walk round the garden,
before tea; so we started on one of those horticultural
pilgrimages which are an absolute necessity to the
moral welfare of all garden-lovers.  Frank, having
shared in the forget-me-not tribulation, was a
partaker in Annabel's joy at the sky-blue blush now
spreading over the bed; and Fay asked all the right
questions and said all the right things.  She even went
so far as to wonder whether Queen Elizabeth ever sat
under the mulberry tree, thereby giving Annabel her
always-longed-for opportunity of explaining that
mulberry trees were unknown in England until the
reign of James the First.
</p>

<p>
Frank pulled up in ecstasy opposite a flame-coloured
azalea that was just bursting into bloom.  "Isn't it
simply ripping?" he exclaimed.  "It's for all the
world like a coloured picture of the Burning Bush in
a Sunday book!"
</p>

<p>
"It reminds one of Mrs. Browning's 'common bush
afire with God,'" added his sister.
</p>

<p>
"The flame-coloured azaleas are not as common
as the pink-and-white ones," explained Annabel the
Literal.  "And I am sorry to see that this particular
plant is becoming overshadowed by an elder-tree,"
she added, fiercely breaking off an overhanging branch
of the offending elder with her own hands.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little azalea!" exclaimed Fay; "I pity it.
It is so crushing to be overshadowed by one's elders.
We have all been through it, and so we know exactly
how it feels."
</p>

<p>
Annabel apparently did not hear the joke, and she
most certainly did not see it.  "I must speak to
Cutler about the elder-trees," she went on, "and
tell him to cut them down more.  To my mind
he is letting them have their own way far too
much."
</p>

<p>
"It's an awful mistake to let one's elders have too
much of their own way," said Frank.  "Let us be
careful that we don't do it, Fay."
</p>

<p>
Annabel heard that time.  "You are confusing two
words, Frank," she kindly explained.  "I was referring
to elder-trees.  There are two kinds of elders:
the people who are older than ourselves, and the elders
that grow in the garden."
</p>

<p>
"And the elders that grew in Susanna's garden,"
added the irrepressible Frank, "that's a third
kind."
</p>

<p>
I smothered a laugh, and Annabel looked shocked:
Fay's laugh showed no signs of any smothering.
"I do not approve of young people reading the
Apocrypha," my sister said rather stiffly: "it is not
suitable for them."
</p>

<p>
"But it's in the Bible in a sort of way," pleaded
Fay, "we were allowed to read it at Miss Wylies'."
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly the Bible; I could not call it the
Bible."  Annabel was relentless.
</p>

<p>
Fay nodded airily.  "I know what you mean: sort
of, but not quite.  Rather like an Irish peer: no
seat in the Lords, but a peer for all practical purposes."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked puzzled.  "We were talking of the
Bible, not of the Peerage," she explained, as if the
two words were of a similar nature and so apt to be
confused with one another.  And to her mind I
believe they were.
</p>

<p>
"Of course we were," said Fay; "how stupid of me
to mix up the two!"  Then she went on: "The
forget-me-nots will be divine in a week or two!"  (She
was looking at the debatable bed from a becoming
distance.)  "A lovely blue pool that you will long
to bathe in."
</p>

<p>
Frank opened his mouth to reply, but I was too
quick for him.  "No further reference to Susanna, if
you please," I said <i>sotto voce</i>, laying a firm hand on
his arm: "this is no place for her."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of her," he replied, with his
bubbling laugh, "when Fay began about bathing in
the pool."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you were: that's why I stopped you."
</p>

<p>
Frank's suppressed bubble continued.  I wanted to
join in it, but I daren't.
</p>

<p>
"How exquisite the house looks from here,"
exclaimed Fay.  "I do adore the rose-colour of the
bricks that the Tudors used.  They had a nice taste
in bricks."
</p>

<p>
"I think they were a jolly old rosy lot altogether,"
said Frank.  "Took everything as <i>couleur de rose</i>,
don't you know, till it got into their bones and their
bricks!"
</p>

<p>
Fay agreed with this sentiment.  "I dare say that
was it: a sort of Christian Science idea that if you
thought your bricks were <i>couleur de rose</i> they really
became <i>couleur de rose</i>.  And I suppose that is why
all the new houses about London have that horrid
yellow tinge: people nowadays look at everything
through <i>blasé</i>, jaundiced eyes, and so everything
is yellow to them, and eventually gets really
yellow."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would like to see over the house,"
suggested Annabel.  "It is considered one of the
finest specimens of Tudor architecture in Kent, and
has never been touched since the time of Henry the
Eighth."
</p>

<p>
"And to what do you attribute that neglect?&mdash;as
the County Councillor asked when he was shown a
house that hadn't been touched since the reign of
Elizabeth," bubbled Frank.
</p>

<p>
I admit I laughed then: I couldn't help it.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you'd appreciate that," murmured he,
confidentially slipping his arm into mine; "I've been
saving it for days, but never remembered to get it off
my chest when you were there.  You see, you've got
rather a strong Kingsnorth strain in you: it's a pity,
but you can't help it, and when the Kingsnorth strain
comes to the top, it's rather a waste of good material
telling you anything really funny.  You take so long
being shocked, that by the time the shock has subsided
the freshness of the joke has evaporated."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you are right," I said.  I always
consider it a mistake to neglect any opportunity of
seeing myself through another person's eyes, and if
that other person happens to be considerably my
junior, I think the educational advantages of the
vision are enhanced.  To tell the truth&mdash;down at the
bottom of my deceitful and desperately wicked heart&mdash;I
had always cherished a secret belief that the
Kingsnorth strain in me was very faint&mdash;that I was
almost pure Winterford, and it was a considerable and
not altogether pleasant surprise to discover that the
strain, which I had fondly imagined non-existent, was
so strong that it hit onlookers in the face!
</p>

<p>
Fortunately Annabel had not heard Frank's remark
anent the Kingsnorth strain: she was busy preparing
the virgin soil of Fay's mind for an inspection of the
Manor, by casting abroad seeds of information
respecting that ancient building.
</p>

<p>
"And how nice of Queen Elizabeth to have slept
here!" I heard Fay say.  "I think it was too sweet
that way she had of sleeping about all over everywhere
so as to leave a sort of historical train behind
her, like a royal and romantic snail.  It seems to
give such a delicious old flavour to houses, for her even
to have dozed in them.  But though she was all right
sleeping, I can't say that I am fond of her in her
waking moments, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I consider she was a great woman," replied
Annabel, "and such a friend to the English Church."
</p>

<p>
But friendship towards the English Church was not
the sort of thing to appeal to Miss Wildacre.  "Still,
think of her behaviour to Mary Queen of Scots," she
expostulated: "I can never forgive her for that.
Think of cutting off that beautiful head out of sheer
jealousy!  It was simply abominable!"
</p>

<p>
"Mary Stuart was a Papist," replied Annabel, as if
that fact were in itself an excuse for any atrocity.
And to Annabel's mind I verily believe it was.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what that has to do with it, Miss
Kingsnorth: I really don't see that people's religion
matters much to anybody except themselves,
provided, of course, that they're decent and don't
practice Obi or devil-worship, or go in for human
sacrifices, or do any quite impossible things of that
kind.  I think that religion is very much a matter of
temperament, don't you?&mdash;and that what's good for
one person is bad for another."
</p>

<p>
I felt it was high time for me to interfere, so,
throwing off Frank's affectionate arm, I joined the
two ladies, and suggested that I should show Fay over
the house before tea.
</p>

<p>
It was an intense delight to show Fay Wildacre the
house that was so dear to me.  At the time I wondered
that so apparently small a thing should afford such
an infinity of pleasure; but later on I understood the
reason why.  On we went through the old rooms and
along the old corridors, Fay enlivening the way with
her deliciously naïve conversation and comments,
which&mdash;though always charming to me&mdash;I was sometimes
relieved that Annabel could not hear.  I was
fast coming to the conclusion that Fay would have
to be Bowdlerized for Annabel, and that the work
of Bowdlerization would fall upon me.  And to
Bowdlerize one human being for another is a terrible
task for any man, more especially if the two people
happen to be women, and most especially if they
happen to be women both dear to him.
</p>

<p>
Finally we came to the nursery, where Ponty sat
in state.
</p>

<p>
"This is my old nurse," I said, introducing the
curtsying Ponty to Fay, "and this, Ponty, is Miss
Wildacre, who has come to live at the Rectory."
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" said Fay, shaking hands in
that charming manner of hers which combined the
candour of a child with the dignity of a princess, and
the smile which accompanied her words went straight
to Ponty's faithful old heart, and never came out
again any more for ever.  "Sir Reginald has been
showing me all over the house, and kept his old
nursery as the nicest bit of all to come at the end."
</p>

<p>
"And Master Reggie was quite right, miss," replied
Ponty; "for sure and certain no children ever had
a cosier nursery than he and Miss Annabel had here:
so warm and light and airy, that it's no wonder they
grew into such a fine pair."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I expect they owe their fineness to their nurse
rather than to their nursery," said Fay, with her
ready tact; "they grew so tall because you took such
good care of them.  I dare say if they hadn't had
you for a nurse they'd have been no bigger than my
brother and me."
</p>

<p>
"Mr Wildacre is small, I admit, miss; but you're
quite a good height, though so thin.  However, I
doubt the Restham air will soon put that to rights.
I remember when I was a child there was a girl came
to Poppenhall&mdash;Poppenhall being my old home in the
Midlands&mdash;so thin and delicate-looking that you could
see through her, as the saying is, she having been
brought up in London, where the air is half smoke and
the milk is half water.  And by the time she'd been
at Poppenhall three months&mdash;being out-of-doors and
milk warm from the cows three times a day&mdash;she was
that stout that she broke the springs of my
grandfather's gig when he took her back to the station
in it."
</p>

<p>
Fay nodded her head in the engaging little way
that she shared with her brother.  "I dare say
Restham will have a similar effect on me, and that when
I leave I shall have to be drawn out of the place by a
traction-engine."
</p>

<p>
Ponty beamed.  "I see you're like Mr. Wildacre,
miss, always ready for a bit of fun."
</p>

<p>
"Still you must admit that Restham hasn't made
Sir Reginald very fat," said Fay, looking me up and
down with a critical eye.  (And for the first time in
my life I thanked Heaven that Restham hadn't.)
</p>

<p>
"No, miss; there you have me.  Master Reggie
was always one of Pharaoh's lean kine, and always
will be.  It didn't seem to matter when he was young,
as I like to see young folks slim and active; but I
must say that at his time of life he ought to be getting
a bit more flesh on his bones, to help him to fill up
his position and look more important and like what
a baronet should be."
</p>

<p>
Again I was conscious of a distinct wave of irritation.
Why would Annabel and Ponty rub it in so
about my age?  Surely they could have left the
subject alone&mdash;for this one afternoon, at any rate!
</p>

<p>
"I suppose when all's said and done," continued
Ponty, "it is a judgment on him for not getting
married.  Now if he'd only a wife and half-a-dozen
children to look after him&mdash;as he ought to have at his
age&mdash;he'd be as stout and well-liking as anybody."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe a wife and half-a-dozen children
would look after him as well as you and Miss
Kingsnorth do," said Fay, with some truth, in nowise
shocked at the mention of the half-dozen children, as
Annabel would have been at her age.
</p>

<p>
"But it 'ud be more natural, miss.  Still, as I
always say, there's hope for all, and marrying late
is in Sir Reginald's family on both sides.  Her
ladyship was by no means young when she married, and
Sir John was getting on in years.  Which being the
case, I haven't but lost hope for Sir Reginald or even
for Miss Annabel; though I must own as the gentleman
as gets Miss Annabel will have found his master,
whoever he may be."
</p>

<p>
Fay smiled, and I tried hard not to.  It seemed
somehow more disloyal to smile at Annabel with Fay
than with Frank.  "Come and see the view," I said,
going to the deep bay-window, the window-seat of
which had been our toy-box in the years gone by.
</p>

<p>
Fay expressed her admiration in no measured terms,
and then we said good-bye to Ponty and retraced our
steps.
</p>

<p>
"How lovely it must be to have had the same home
all your life!" exclaimed Fay.  "To have moved on
an axis instead of in an orbit, and to have looked at
the same things with the eyes of different ages!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you have had a good many different
homes," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, scores and scores.  Both Father and Mother
were very restless people, and never could settle long
in the same place.  And after Mother died, Father
grew even more restless, and was always wanting to
be on the move.  Frankie and I are annuals&mdash;not
perennials&mdash;and have never taken root anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Still it must have been rather exciting to move
about so much."
</p>

<p>
"It was, in a picnicky sort of way, and of course
it kept one from getting even the tiniest bit
moss-grown or worm-eaten.  But the nuisance of it was
that we never could find anything that we wanted,
because things get so awfully muddled up in a move,
and no one can remember where they have been put."
</p>

<p>
"I conclude that a move is even worse than a
spring-cleaning," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Much, much worse, though on the same lines; a
sort of spring-cleaning possessed by the Devil."
</p>

<p>
"And I suppose that all the lost goods turned up
eventually?"
</p>

<p>
Fay nodded her head with the little trick of manner
I had already unconsciously begun to love.  "A move&mdash;like
the sea&mdash;will eventually give up its dead; but
it does so on the instalment principle."
</p>

<p>
By that time we were down in the entrance-hall
again, where Annabel was presiding over the
tea-table, and Frank officiating as a sort of acolyte.
</p>

<p>
"Come and have some tea," I said, giving Fay a
seat at the gate-legged table.
</p>

<p>
And I felt younger and gladder than I had felt for
years at the sight of poor Wildacre's daughter sitting
at my board and eating my salt.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE FIRST MIRACLE
</h3>

<p>
That summer was to me a trip into fairyland.
</p>

<p>
In the first place I threw up the role of uncle which
Annabel has so thoughtfully cast for me, and played
the part of Romeo instead: that is to say, for the
first time in all my forty-two years, I fell madly and
irretrievably in love.
</p>

<p>
There is no need to expatiate upon my symptoms.
Those who have themselves travelled through Arcady
know all about the effect of the excursion without any
explanations from me, and to those who have never
set foot upon the enchanted shores, a description of
the trip would be both wearisome and unintelligible.
Consequently I (as I think wisely) forbear.
</p>

<p>
But I not only visited the paradise of Love that
happy summer; I also visited the paradise of Youth.
For the first time in my life&mdash;save the time of my
residence in Oxford, when my constitutional shyness
marred the joy of intercourse with my contemporaries&mdash;I
was thrown into the society of young people, and
lived in an atmosphere of joyous adventure untainted
by any breath of care or responsibility.  Sometimes
as I stood on the lawn of the Manor House and looked
at the moss-grown old sundial, I thought to myself
that for me the ancient miracle had once again been
wrought, and the shadow on the dial had been moved
ten degrees backward.  But underneath this delightful
fancy lay the hard, unyielding truth&mdash;supported
by Burke and Debrett in print, and by Annabel and
Ponty in practical politics&mdash;that, however juvenile
and sentimental I might feel, I was still a man of
forty-two, with the greater part of my life behind me,
while Fay was standing on the threshold of her opening
womanhood, with the kingdoms of this world still
spread before her advancing feet.
</p>

<p>
The uncle-myth still held sway in Annabel's
imagination; therefore it never occurred to her that
any sort of chaperonage was needful as between myself
and Fay.  For this I was devoutly thankful.  True,
Frank was with us whenever he could elude Blathwayte's
conscientious preparation of him for the
University; but Arthur's rule, if kind, was firm, and
consequently Fay and I spent long and blissful hours
together with no one to intrude into our <i>solitude
à deux</i>.
</p>

<p>
It did not take me long to discover that though the
twins were so much alike outwardly&mdash;not only in
appearance, but also in voice and manner, and in
tricks of thought and speech&mdash;the resemblance was
merely a superficial one.  Their bodies and their
minds were cast in the same mould; but their hearts
and their souls differed fundamentally.  Frank was
the elf throughout: his feelings were transient and
wayward.  But underneath his sister's fairylike
appearance and demeanour, there was hidden the
loving and faithful heart of a true woman.  Frank
was the cold-blooded merman untouched by mortal
pain and sorrow; but Fay was the little sea-maid who
had found a soul.
</p>

<p>
It was the time of hay-harvest, when all the world
is filled with fragrance, and every separate hayfield
is a picture in itself.  Fay and I were sitting under a
hedge in one of the upper meadows, watching the
old-world drama of haymaking being played in the valley
below, in which drama Frank was assisting.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it all perfectly ideal?" Fay exclaimed.  "I
never in my life knew anything so exquisite as an
English summer!"
</p>

<p>
"I never in all my life knew anything so exquisite
as this particular English summer," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it is unusually fine weather for the time
of year," said Fay, with a sly smile.
</p>

<p>
"It is not on the weather that this summer bases
its claim to super-excellence," I explained.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed: on the circumstances then, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, on the company.  I have arrived at the
interesting conclusion that a summer minus you is
not really a summer at all, only a sort of
dress-rehearsal of the real performance."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Fay; "one swallow does not make a
summer, but one Wildacre does."
</p>

<p>
"One Fay Wildacre," I corrected her.  "Frank
alone would only be able to make a spring: plenty
of promise but no fulfilment, and a cold wind at the
back of the sunshine."
</p>

<p>
Fay nodded her pretty curly head.  "That's rather
a neat description of Frankie.  Now you mention it,
he is like a brilliantly sunny day with a cold wind
in the background ready to pop round the corner at
any moment and shrivel you up.  Although Frankie
is so adorable when he likes, I don't think he has got
what people call a warm heart; do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he is very fond of you," I replied
diplomatically.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he is, but that's different.  You don't
require a warm heart to be fond of your own people:
that's just nature and habit.  What I call a warm
heart is the sort of heart that makes you adore
your friends, and worship your lovers, and find the
world well lost for somebody you've only met twice
before."
</p>

<p>
Fay picked up a stalk of grass and began tickling
her cheek with it.  For the first time in my life I
became envious of the vegetable kingdom.  "Should
you call me a person with a warm heart?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are very fond of Miss Kingsnorth,"
replied Fay demurely.
</p>

<p>
"That's different: it's just nature and habit to be
fond of your own people.  You see, you are not the
only one who can quote.  What I want to know is,
do you consider that I have a warm heart?"
</p>

<p>
"How on earth can I tell its temperature?"
</p>

<p>
"Better than anybody.  You hold it in the hollow
of your hand."
</p>

<p>
"Then it can't be very warm or else it would burn
my fingers and I should drop it," laughed the girl;
"so that question answers itself."
</p>

<p>
"Then allow me to ask another.  Have you got
what people call a warm heart?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her slender shoulders.  "Temperature
ninety-eight, point four&mdash;absolutely normal.  So no
further bulletins will be issued."  And with that, for
the time being, I had to be content.
</p>

<p>
"I do love a west wind," Fay said, after a few
minutes of blissful silence, "don't you?  I think it
is the nicest wind we have, combining the softness
of the South with the bracingness of the North: like
people with sharp tongues and sweet tempers."
</p>

<p>
I agreed with this&mdash;as indeed I was ready to do
with any idea to which Fay gave utterance; for Love
is no whit behind Conscience in the manufacture of
cowards.
</p>

<p>
"I always think the different winds are different
colours," she went on; "the North wind is white,
the South wind yellow, the East wind blue and the
West wind green.  At least, that's how they always
seem to me."
</p>

<p>
"And it's a very good description of them, too," I
said, as I should have said just then of any description
given by Fay.
</p>

<p>
"What's going on down there," she suddenly exclaimed,
pointing to the field spread out at our feet
where the hay-cutting machine was going round and
round in an ever-diminishing circle.  "There seems
to be a sort of fuss on!"
</p>

<p>
My eyes were useless in a case like this, so I had
to ask Fay for further information.  "The machine
has stopped," she said, "and there is a crowd of
labourers round it, and all the haymakers from the
next field have left off haymaking and are rushing to
join the crowd."
</p>

<p>
"There must have been an accident," I said, rising
from my seat under the hedge; "let us go down and
see what is the matter.  I always hate all reaping
machines, they are so apt to cut off people's
legs."
</p>

<p>
"I hate machines of any kind," agreed Fay, as we
hastened down the hill together; "they are so ugly,
and make such a noise.  When I come out of the
machinery-in-motion part of an exhibition, I always
feel as if I'd been in hell."
</p>

<p>
I was thankful Annabel was not present to hear this
description, but I smiled at it nevertheless.  "And
machine-made things are so horrid, too," I said;
"they lose the individual touch, which makes for
charm and originality."
</p>

<p>
Fay nodded.  "I know.  You can't really be fond
of things which are made by the score exactly alike.
I don't believe that even parents would be fond of
their children if they were turned out in dozens like
the plates of a dinner-service."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes we reached the crowd in the
hayfield, which respectfully parted to make way for us;
and then with an exceeding bitter cry, which tore my
heart-strings to breaking-point, Fay rushed forward
and fell on her knees beside the recumbent form of
Frank, who was lying white and unconscious on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Then there followed a dreadful time for Fay, and
for me, too, as by that time whatever hurt her hurt
me also.  Frank, with his usual light-hearted
carelessness, had stood too near to that horrible
Juggernaut, the hay-cutting machine, with the terrible
consequence that one of the scythes had nearly cut off
his foot.
</p>

<p>
We carried him on a hurdle to the Rectory, and
for days he hung between life and death.  Sometimes
it seemed impossible to believe that a creature so full
of life as Frank could die, and then again it seemed
incredible that any one so terribly wounded could
live.  But at last lock-jaw set in, and then the doctors
pronounced the case absolutely hopeless.
</p>

<p>
It was torture to me to see Fay's agony of mind;
yet there was a sweetness mingled with the bitterness
in my knowledge of the fact that she turned to me
for help and comfort; at least, hardly for comfort&mdash;the
time for comfort had not yet arrived, but for that
sympathy in her sorrow, which is very near akin to
consolation.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was very capable and efficient during this
sad time&mdash;a veritable rock of strength to all of us
who clung to her.  But although she could have done
far more for Fay than my poor, blundering, male
self could ever do, I could not blind my eyes to the
fact that&mdash;with sweet, childish perversity&mdash;Fay clung
to me rather than to Annabel.  That the child was
foolish in this, I could not but admit; but I loved her
all the more for her dear folly.
</p>

<p>
I had come to the Rectory to hear the verdict of
the great specialist from London, and he had gone
back to town, leaving Jeffson, our local doctor, to
make Frank's passing as easy as possible.  Fay was
with the nurses in Frank's room, and I was loafing
aimlessly about with nothing to do, and nothing that
was worth doing.  Like all days of great sorrow, the
day seemed neither a Sunday nor a weekday, but
a sort of terrible Good Friday, with the darkness and
the earthquake looming nearer every moment.
</p>

<p>
Apart from my agony of pity for Fay, I was sorely
grieved on my own account at the thought of losing
Frank.  A strong friendship had grown up between
the boy and myself&mdash;a friendship that was fraught
with joy for me.  Although I had eschewed the
avuncular attitude arranged for me by Annabel towards
Fay, I had accepted it with regard to Frank; and
when I heard the verdict of the great doctor from
London, I felt as if I were indeed losing a
dearly-beloved nephew.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I was aimlessly wandering about the Rectory
dining-room, Arthur came in.
</p>

<p>
"How is the boy now?" I asked, though I knew
too well what the answer would be.
</p>

<p>
"Just the same.  Jeffson says there will not be
much change now until the end."
</p>

<p>
"And Fay?"
</p>

<p>
"Bearing up wonderfully, poor child!  She is so
brave and calm now that I fear it will be the worse
for her when the need for calmness and courage is
over.  Reggie, I have telephoned for Henderson, and
he is coming at once."
</p>

<p>
"Who is Henderson?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"A great friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
I sighed.  "I don't see the use of torturing the
poor boy with any more doctors, Arthur.  Both Sir
Frederic and Jeffson pronounced the case absolutely
hopeless."
</p>

<p>
"But Henderson isn't a doctor," replied Arthur in
his leisurely way.
</p>

<p>
"Then why send for him?" I asked most unreasonably.
</p>

<p>
"He is a spiritual healer, and has worked some
wonderful cures.  If any one can save Frank, he can."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in that sort of thing," I replied,
with all the irritability of helpless misery.
</p>

<p>
"Probably not; but I don't see what that has to
do with it.  Our belief in anything doesn't affect the
thing itself, it only affects us."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you believe that your friend can cure the
boy, after three doctors have given him up?"
</p>

<p>
Arthur thought for a moment, and then he said:
"No, I don't believe that Henderson can cure the
boy; but I believe that Christ working through
Henderson can do so, and I am going to see if He
will."
</p>

<p>
We were both silent for a few minutes, and then
Blathwayte suddenly said: "By the way, I have
forgotten the thing I came down to say to you.  Fay
wants you to go and sit with her in Frank's room."
</p>

<p>
I went at once.  Fay's lightest word was law to me.
</p>

<p>
For an hour or two I sat in the sick-room, where
the girl whom I loved knelt beside her dying brother.
The doctor and the day-nurse were doing all they
could to fan the flame that was so rapidly being
extinguished, but that all amounted to very little.
Already the beautiful boyish mouth was closed too
tightly for any nourishment or stimulant to pass
through the once mobile lips, and the boy could not
have spoken even if he had wished to do so; but he
was too ill now to desire to speak, and lay in rigid
unconsciousness waiting for the end to come.  Nobody
spoke, except the doctor and the nurse; but I
knew in my soul that it helped Fay to feel me near,
and so I stayed while the hours rolled on and Frank's
life ebbed away.
</p>

<p>
I had lost all count of time when the door was
softly opened, and Arthur, followed by a stranger,
came into the room, which stranger was the exact
opposite of what I had expected.
</p>

<p>
I had pictured the Spiritual Healer to myself as a
wild, emaciated, long-haired figure&mdash;a sort of cross
between an ideal poet and John the Baptist: instead
of which I beheld a tall, broad-shouldered, immaculately
dressed Londoner, with the quiet manners and
easy assurance of the typical man about town.  I am
almost ashamed to own it, only one never should be
ashamed to own the truth; but&mdash;absurd as it may
sound&mdash;it was the perfect cut of Mr. Henderson's coat
that suddenly made the man and his mission real to
me.  Had he worn the garb of a monk, I should have
relegated him to the sphere of mediæval superstition;
had he worn the dress of a priest, I should have placed
him in the category of hysterical revivalists; but I
felt an irresistible conviction that a man in such a
well-cut and fashionable coat as his could only preach
a gospel as practical and convincing as the <i>Times</i> of
that morning.
</p>

<p>
Blathwayte hurriedly indicated to Mr. Henderson
who we all were, and then they both knelt down
beside the bed, the rest of us following their example.
</p>

<p>
I cannot give a dramatic account of what followed,
simply because there was nothing dramatic about it.
At the time it seemed&mdash;as it has always seemed to me
in recalling it&mdash;to be the most natural and simple
thing in the world.  To make it any way thrilling or
dramatic would rob it, to my mind, of its strength,
and convincingness.
</p>

<p>
First Mr. Henderson offered up aloud an extempore
prayer that Frank's sufferings might be relieved and
his life spared.  Even the word "prayer" seems
almost too stilted and transcendental to convey my
meaning: he rather besought a favour of a present
Person, with an assurance that that Person's sympathies
were so entirely enlisted on his side, that the
granting of his petition was a foregone conclusion.
</p>

<p>
I had been brought up in a godly home, and had
been conversant with religious phrases and expressions
all my life.  But not until I heard Mr. Henderson
speaking to that Other Person, whose love for and interest
in Frank (so Henderson obviously took for granted)
were infinitely stronger and deeper than ours could
ever be, did I realise what was meant by the
expression "a living Christ."  From my childhood I had
loved and worshipped a dimly glorious Figure,
half-hidden in a haze of golden light, who had trodden
the Syrian fields nearly two thousand years ago, and
had died, and risen again, and ascended heavenwards
leaving behind Him an inspired Gospel and a
perfect Example; but now I suddenly felt that the
dimly-remembered Ideal was not an Ideal at all, but
a living Person, standing in Frank's room close beside
us, as actual and real as we were ourselves: that it
was no shadowy Syrian Prophet that I had
worshipped, but a Man of to-day as much as of yesterday&mdash;a
Man of London and Paris as much as of Jerusalem
and Galilee&mdash;and a Man who was also God.
</p>

<p>
As a boy I remember being thrilled with the story
of the unknown knight who feasted with Robin Hood
and his men, and who&mdash;at the end of the day&mdash;lifted
up his visor and they knew he was the King.  And
the same thrill&mdash;though in a far greater degree&mdash;ran
through me now.  A Stranger stood in our midst
and wrestled, as we were wrestling, for the life of
Frank, sharing our sorrow and sympathising with our
anxiety, and suddenly the veil was lifted and we knew
He was the King.
</p>

<p>
After his audible prayer was over, Henderson laid
his hands upon Frank, and an intense stillness fell
upon the room whilst the man lifted up his soul to
Heaven in silent petition for the dying boy, and as
he prayed the stiffened muscles relaxed, the harsh
breathing grew easy, and Frank gradually fell into
a peaceful slumber.
</p>

<p>
As soon as he saw that the boy slept, Henderson
made the sign of the Cross upon Frank's brow and
rose from his knees.
</p>

<p>
"The boy will live," he said; "Christ has healed him."
</p>

<p>
The doctor was amazed.  He examined Frank, and
admitted that the tetanus had lost its hold, and that,
provided there was no relapse, the danger was over.
</p>

<p>
The two things that struck me most in the whole
happening were first its unspeakable wonder, and
secondly its absolute naturalness.  But that is the way
with all real miracles: beforehand they appear
impossible, and afterwards inevitable.  Thus it is with
the two great miracles of marriage and parenthood.
An imaginary wife and imaginary children are
amongst the most impossible creations of our dreams;
yet when they come, they seem to have been always
there, and we cannot picture a world without them.
And so I think it will be with the other great miracle
of death.  At present the heart of man fails to
conceive what good things are prepared for us in the land
beyond the grave; but when we are really there, I
believe it will seem one of the most natural things we
have ever known; as natural as that earthly home
where the dream-wife and the dream-children came
true, and made the life before their coming sink into
the realms of vain and half-forgotten things.
</p>

<p>
When we had left Frank's room, and were waiting
downstairs for Mr. Henderson's motor, which was to
take him back to London, I asked him&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How do you explain your gift of healing?"
</p>

<p>
"I have but one explanation," he answered: "as
many as touched the hem of His garment were made
perfectly whole."
</p>

<p>
"Then do you not put it down to the influence of
mind over matter&mdash;which is an influence we are only
just beginning to realise?" I urged.
</p>

<p>
"I put it down to nothing but the power of Christ,"
replied Henderson.  "I find that as long as people
talk about mentality, or suggestion, or will-power, or
the influence of mind over matter, or the particle of
Godhead inherent in ourselves, the world will listen
to them, and follow after them, and believe in their
cures; but the minute we put all these things on
one side and teach that there is no power in anything
save in Christ Jesus and Him crucified, the world
becomes shy of us at once and looks the other way.
Yet there is no help for any of us but in His Name,
neither in this world nor in the world to come."
</p>

<p>
"But how would you explain this working of His
power?" asked Arthur.  "I suppose He would work
by means of mental suggestion, or something of that
kind."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Henderson shook his head.  "I never attempt
to explain: I only believe.  I know that He does
certain things, but how He does them is no business
of mine."
</p>

<p>
"We are too fond of explaining things nowadays,"
said Arthur.  "I think we should do well to follow
the example of the Cherubim who used two of their
wings to cover their faces, because there were things
into which they were not desired to look.  We, on
the contrary, try to pry into everything."
</p>

<p>
"But we have as yet no wings with which to cover
our faces," I suggested.  "It is only because we are
low and earthy that we pry.  As we grow higher we
shall grow humbler, and by the time that we attain
to wings we shall know how to use them."
</p>

<p>
"And until we know how to use them we shall probably
not get the wings," added Arthur.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me one thing," I said, turning to Mr. Henderson.
"Do you think that everybody who has sufficient
faith in Christ could heal as you do?"
</p>

<p>
"That again I do not know.  It is all in His hands.
But I am inclined to think that as there are diversities
of gifts but the same Spirit, so the gift of healing is
given to one, the gift of preaching to another, and so
on, and we have not all the same gifts.  It is all Christ
working in us; but He works one way in one person
and another way in another.  We must cultivate the
gift that we have, and be content to do without the
gifts that have been denied us, and as we are all
members of Christ there can be no rivalry amongst us."
</p>

<p>
"After all," I said after a moment's silence, "we
are sent into the world to do the Will and not to
trouble about the Doctrine: that follows the other
as a matter of course.  And submission is the most
necessary and the most difficult lesson we have to
learn.  If we were allowed to choose our gifts I should
have chosen the one of healing; but we are not allowed
to choose."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Henderson looked at me intently for a moment
with his piercing dark eyes.  "I do not know, but I
think that you have the gift of healing," he said;
"utterly uncultivated and undeveloped, but ready for
Christ's use, should He need it."
</p>

<p>
And then the motor came round, and he drove away
to the multitudinous duties awaiting him in town, and
I went upstairs to rejoice with Fay, as before I had
mourned with her.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
ST. LUKE'S SUMMER
</h3>

<p>
It was a bright autumn morning, and the central
hall of the Manor House was given up to a Moloch
worshipped by Annabel and described by her as the
"Ladies' Needlework Guild."  I had learnt from long
and bitter experience that the festival of this Moloch
fell in the first week in October, and during that time
there was not a chair or a Chesterfield or even a table
in the great hall which was not covered with heaps
of unbleached and evil-smelling garments.  To the
uninitiated it looked like an extensive preparation for
something which Ponty called "the Wash," and which
was long confused in my childish mind with that
portion of the North Sea which separates Norfolk from
Lincolnshire; but the initiated knew better.  I never
really grasped the true inwardness of this Moloch of
my sister's.  Once, in an unguarded moment, I asked
Annabel how the Ladies' Needlework Guild was
worked and what it did; and for three-quarters of an
hour on end&mdash;without even a half-time for sucking
lemons&mdash;she volubly expounded to me the manifold
rules and regulations of the fetish.  Needless to say
I didn't understand; but after that I always pretended
that I did, for fear Annabel should explain again.
As far as I could grasp the situation, the monster had
to be fed with a huge meal of unbleached calico,
flannelette, rough flannel and other inexpensive and
somewhat odoriferous materials, served in the form of
useful undergarments, some of which it swallowed
whole, and some of which it generously returned to
the respective parishes whence they had originally
sprung.  But the reasons why they were given to the
monster, and why the monster gave some of them
back again, I have never even attempted to fathom.
But that yearly festival was to Annabel as sacred as
the Feast of Tabernacles is to the Jews or the Feast
of Ramadhan is to the Mohammedans; and the smell
of its flannelette and unbleached calico was as incense
in my sister's nostrils.
</p>

<p>
On this particular October morning she and Fay
were apparently sorting clothes for a gigantic laundry,
but were actually assisting at one of Annabel's most
holy rites.  I sank on to a settee, full of wonder at
the marvellous power the gentler sex possesses of
transforming into a sacred ritual the most ordinary
and commonplace actions.
</p>

<p>
But I was not allowed to sit for long.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, Reggie, you are sitting upon
St. Etheldreda's flannel petticoats.  Do get up at once!"
</p>

<p>
I rose with due apologies to the saint in question.
</p>

<p>
"Those were St. Etheldreda's flannel petticoats on
that sofa, weren't they, Fay?" continued my sister.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied her acolyte, "and the rest of
St. Etheldreda's garments are on the chair by the
fire-place.  Hadn't I better put them all together, and do
the Etheldreda bundle up?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, my dear.  I think St. Etheldreda's
garments are too scanty at present."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, they ought not to be," I said sternly;
"I am both shocked and surprised."
</p>

<p>
"You see it is such a poor parish," continued
Annabel "that we ought to send them a good large
grant and I don't think the garments which we have
already allotted to St. Etheldreda's are sufficient, in
spite of the extra petticoats.  I must add some more
to them.  Lady Westerham has sent me a lot of such
beautiful scarlet flannel petticoats, Reggie, and I want
to divide them equally amongst the poorest parishes.
I shouldn't send any of those to St. James's, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," I interrupted; "they wouldn't be
at all appropriate."
</p>

<p>
Fay began to laugh.  "I really don't see anything
to laugh at," said Annabel good-humouredly; "Reggie
is quite right in agreeing with me that it is not
appropriate to send our best garments to a comparatively
wealthy parish like St. James's.  Those calico shirts
that Mrs. Jones sent can go to St. James's; they're
quite good enough for that.  I always think that the
Vicar of St. James's is a most grasping person,
considering how many well-to-do people he has in his
parish.  I am not going to send him any of my warmest
garments; I shall only send him my shirts and socks
and things like that.  If he wants expensive flannel
petticoats he must buy them for himself, for he
certainly shan't have them from the Guild."
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" I asked, picking up a grey knitted
habiliment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's one of St. Stephen's sweaters, Ponty
knitted them," replied Annabel.  "The Vicar of
St. Stephen's is a very worthy young man, who has
organized a cricket team or a football eleven or something
of that sort among the poorest boys of his parish,
and he asked me if the Guild could send sweaters for
them to play in as they have nothing themselves but
rags.  Where are the rest of them, Fay?"
</p>

<p>
Fay indicated a shapeless mass of grey matter
underneath the gate-legged table.
</p>

<p>
Annabel continued to flit like a bird from one heap
of clothes to another, talking meanwhile in her usual
irrelevant fashion.  "I am very much disappointed
in Summerglade's contribution&mdash;very much
disappointed indeed.  I consider it most shabby.  As a
matter of fact I don't think it is large enough to entitle
them to a grant from the Guild at all.  The Summerglade
people will have to do without any garments at
all this winter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that would hardly do," I meekly suggested,
balancing myself on the arm of a nightgown-covered
chair, like Noah's Ark on the top of Ararat.
</p>

<p>
"Well, they don't deserve any," replied Annabel
sternly.
</p>

<p>
"But that has nothing to do with it," I argued,
"in fact quite the reverse.  As far as I can judge, the
only reason for being given garments at all is the fact
that one doesn't deserve them.  If you don't believe me,
let me refer you to the precedent of Adam and Eve."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Reggie, how silly you are to drag Adam and
Eve into a thing like the Needlework Guild, which
has nothing in the world to do with them.  As I've
told you, the rule of the Guild is that for every twenty
garments given by a particular parish, a grant of
twenty garments is allotted to that parish; while the
odd garments outside the twenties are given to the
poorest East-end parishes, who can't afford to send
any garments at all."
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know!" I cried hastily, in a valiant
attempt to stem the flood of Annabel's explanations.
</p>

<p>
But she went on as if I had not spoken.  "Therefore
you see, when a well-to-do parish sends less than
twenty garments, it doesn't get any grant at all; and
that is just what I am saying about Summerglade.
Summerglade didn't send as many as twenty
garments, did it, Fay?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss Kingsnorth, only a measly seventeen."
</p>

<p>
"I blame the Vicar, Mr. Sneyd, for that," said
Annabel severely.  "He is a most feeble person, and
takes no interest at all in the Needlework Guild.  He
called here for a subscription for Foreign Missions the
other day, which I considered a great impertinence,
as I cannot see what claim the foreign heathen of
Summerglade have upon me.  I thought him a most
stupid man."
</p>

<p>
"I thought him a blooming idiot," exclaimed Fay.
</p>

<p>
Annabel started as if she had been shot.  "Oh, my
dear, what an improper expression to make use of."
</p>

<p>
"I learnt it from Frankie," Fay explained; "he is
always calling people blooming idiots."
</p>

<p>
"But Frank is different," said Annabel, who would
have found an excuse for Frank if he had committed
murder.
</p>

<p>
"I don't recognise any difference at all," said I,
taking up the cudgels on Fay's behalf.  "I cannot
see that the bloom is in any way rubbed off the idiot
by Fay's using the expression instead of Frank."
</p>

<p>
"But it is different, Reggie.  There is a difference
between boys and girls, whether you see it or not.  I
can quite understand that, as Frank and Fay are so
much alike, they seem to you like the same person.
But they are not really the same, and I am surprised
at your stupidity in thinking that they are."
</p>

<p>
Annabel might marvel at my obtuseness, but not
more than I marvelled at hers.
</p>

<p>
Fay bent low over St. Etheldreda's petticoats, but
not low enough to prevent my seeing that she did so
in order to hide a smile, which smile, to my disgust,
brought the blood into my cheeks as if I had been a
raw youth of seventeen instead of an avuncular person
of forty-two.
</p>

<p>
"Come out into the garden, Fay," I said, hopping
down from my perch upon Mount Ararat in a feeble
attempt to cover my infantile confusion; "it is a
shame to spend St. Luke's summer in the atmosphere
of St. James's unbleached shirts."
</p>

<p>
Annabel corrected me.  "It isn't St. Luke's
summer yet, Reggie&mdash;not till the 15th.  And I cannot
possibly leave the house until all the Guild things are
properly sorted; but young people need more fresh
air than people of our age do; so if you like to take
Fay out for a little walk, I will ring for Ponty and
one of the housemaids to come and help me in
apportioning the garments."
</p>

<p>
"All right; come along, Fay, and take what fresh
air your youth needs," I said rather grimly; "or else
Annabel and I shall be summoned by the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children."
</p>

<p>
I was furious with myself for blushing, and just
a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;furious with Fay for smiling
so as to make me blush; for although I had been mad
enough to fall in love with a girl twenty-four years
younger than myself, I had no intention of being
selfish enough to ask that girl to marry me and hamper
her youth with my crabbed age.  Therefore I had
made up my mind to keep my love to myself, and
not to let Fay guess that I regarded her save in the
avuncular fashion that Annabel had ordained for me.
Madly in love though I was, I had still sense enough
left to see that youth must mate with youth, and
that it would be impossible for a girl of eighteen to
love a man of forty-two as a woman ought to love her
husband.  But I knew that Fay was attached to me,
and I felt that there was just a possibility&mdash;though
hardly a probability&mdash;that she might, in her youth and
inexperience, mistake that niecely devotion for
something warmer.  Therefore I felt bound in honour to
save her from herself, in the unlikely event of her
imagining herself in love with me.  And I thought
that the best way of doing this was to support
Annabel's fiction of my own avuncular attitude of
mind and heart.
</p>

<p>
But that smile which had endeavoured to hide itself
in St. Etheldreda's petticoats raised a doubt in my
mind as to the efficacy of my disguise; whilst the
ridiculous blush on my part, which had arisen out of
the smile, showed me that the garment of friendship,
in which I had wrapped myself, needed a considerable
amount of repair.  So I thought that the time had
arrived for that necessary evil which Annabel
described as "a word in season."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish to give credit where credit is not
due," I said, following Fay into the garden and
walking by her side along the denuded pergola; "and
if Annabel says this isn't St. Luke's summer, of course
it isn't.  But whatever saint is responsible for it I must
say he has done his work well, for a better imitation
of an ordinary and garden summer I never saw."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it glorious?" exclaimed Fay, absolutely
skipping by my side in the sheer joy of living and
drinking in great draughts of the sun-warmed air.
St. Martin is another of the saints who are famous
for manufacturing imitation summers, but I believe
his little affair does not come off till November so
I think this must be St. Luke's after all, a bit before
the time. He may have got confused, you see, and
thought it was a movable feast, like Easter.  Even
saints make mistakes sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"The Ladies' Needlework Guild isn't a movable
feast.  The saints may be unpunctual, but Annabel
never is.  The first week of every October finds the
scent of unbleached calico rising like incense from
our house to heaven."
</p>

<p>
Fay fell in with my mood at once.  That was one
of the reasons why she attracted me so much: she
was always so adaptable.  And adaptability was such
a change to me after forty-two years of Annabel.
"Not exactly a movable feast, perhaps, but a very
recurrent one.  And as when you fall under the spell
of the lotus-flower it is always afternoon, so when you
fall under the spell of the Needlework Guild it is
always the first week in October.  No sooner is one
October finished, than another comes close on its heels,
crying out for its fill of garments."
</p>

<p>
"But how do you know that?" I asked.  "This
is the first October that you have been here."
</p>

<p>
Fay shook her head.  "That has nothing to do with
it.  The Needlework Guild is one of those things that
ought to be called Pan, don't you know!&mdash;meaning
they are everywhere all at once.  It existed at school,
just as it does here; and the first week of October
came as often then as it does now.  But we can't
grumble at however many Octobers we may get,
provided they are as warm and fine and summery as
this one."
</p>

<p>
Now seemed the appropriate moment for my word
in season.  "But they are not summer after all&mdash;at
least they are only as you say, summery.  These
saints' affairs may be very good imitations, but they
aren't the real thing, you know.  When once the
summer has gone, it has gone, and neither St. Luke
nor St. Martin can bring it back again.  And it is
the same with ourselves.  We may look young and
feel young and all that sort of thing, but we are only
really young once, and when once our youth is gone,
it is gone for ever."
</p>

<p>
Fay looked up into my face with her wonderful
eyes, and she was so near to me that even I could see
their depth and their beauty, though I still refused
to follow Annabel's advice and disfigure myself, and
indirectly my friends, by wearing spectacles.  "You
are very gloomy this morning, Sir Reggie."  ("Sir
Reggie" was the name that she and Frank had
invented for me, as being a compromise between the
stiffness  of "Sir Reginald" and the familiarity of
"Reggie.")  "I'm afraid St. Luke's kindness is
wasted on you, and it is really very ungrateful of you,
as he is doing his best to make things pleasant."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not gloomy, I'm only truthful.  I can't
see any use in pretending that things are different from
what they are," I said.
</p>

<p>
"But there is great use in proving that things
are different from what they seem," replied Fay
enigmatically.
</p>

<p>
By this time we were standing by the old sundial.
"Look at that," I said, laying my hand on the grey
stone pedestal; "no one nowadays can turn the
shadow on the dial ten degrees backward.  It simply
isn't done.  When morning is past it is past, and
when summer is past it is past, and when youth is
past it is past, and not all the saints in the calendar
can bring them back again."
</p>

<p>
"Still One greater than the saints once did turn
the shadow on the dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward.
And if He did it once, why shouldn't He do it again?"
said Fay softly.
</p>

<p>
"Because, my child, He doesn't.  The age of
miracles is past."
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't.  It was a miracle when Mr. Henderson
cured Frank.  You said so yourself.  So miracles
do happen."
</p>

<p>
I was surprised to find Fay persistent on the point,
but I held my own.  "Yes, but not this kind of
miracle.  Frank was made alive again, I admit; but
that doesn't mean that old people like Annabel and
myself will be made young again.  The two cases are
absolutely different.  A miracle may give us back our
future, but no miracle can give us back our past."
</p>

<p>
Fay smiled a strange sort of smile: the sort that I
remember on my mother's face when I was a little
boy; but all she said was, "Oh, if you're going to
pick and choose your miracles, I've done with you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not picking and choosing my miracles, as you
call it, I'm only pointing out that certain things don't
happen, and that people merely make unhappiness for
themselves and for others by pretending or imagining
that they do.  I'm grateful for St. Luke's summer,
but I don't delude myself into imagining that it is
the real summer come back again.  I'm grateful&mdash;and
so is Annabel&mdash;for the young life that you and
Frank have brought into our home and into our lives,
but I don't delude myself with the belief that because
we feel young when we are with you, we really are
young.  It is autumn with Annabel and me, and it
always will be autumn until it changes into winter:
there is no more spring or summer for us, and it would
be foolish as well as futile to imagine that there is."
</p>

<p>
But Fay still argued.  "Frank and I don't make
Miss Kingsnorth feel young, we make her feel most
awfully old and wise and sensible, and she enjoys the
feeling.  She wouldn't be young again for anything,
it would bore her beyond words.  But you are
different: you are quite young really&mdash;in your mind and
soul, I mean&mdash;but you pretend to be old.  You aren't
a St. Luke's summer at all: you are one of those June
days when it seems cold and we light a fire, and then
the sun comes out and we are boiled to death.  You
aren't autumn masquerading as spring: you are really
a boy dressed up as Father Christmas, like those you
see in toy-shops in December."
</p>

<p>
Unspeakably sweet were Fay's words to me, yet I
felt bound in honour to show her how wrong she was.
</p>

<p>
"My dear little girl, you are out of it altogether
this time.  I am not a bit what you think."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are.  But you are not a bit what you
think," she retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am.  You, in the kindness and goodness
of your heart, imagine that I am younger than I am,
because I look younger&mdash;at least, so my friends tell
me, but I am really old, my child, and in a few years'
time&mdash;when you are in the full glory of your
womanhood&mdash;I shall be very old indeed."  This I felt to be
neatly put, as showing Fay&mdash;without my saying it&mdash;that
I was too old to ask her to marry me, much as I
might wish it.  It cut me to the heart to put
voluntarily from me even the off-chance of a happiness
which far exceeded my wildest dreams; but I felt in
honour bound to do it.  How dare I take advantage
of my darling's youth and inexperience to tie her to
a man old enough to be her father?  If I did such a
thing as that, I could never respect myself again.  I
had never longed for youth as I longed for it now,
but wishing a thing is so, does not make it so, and
the sooner that men and women realise this hard
truth the better for them and for all concerning them.
</p>

<p>
I knew that it was possible to make Fay love
me&mdash;or rather, to make her imagine that she loved me.
At present she saw no men of her own class, save
myself and Blathwayte, and, without, I think, undue
vanity on my part, I could not help realising that I
was more attractive than&mdash;though in every other way
infinitely inferior to&mdash;Arthur.  But when she grew
older and went out into the world and saw more men
of her own age whom she could really love, she would
never forgive me&mdash;as I could never forgive myself&mdash;if
through my selfishness she had lost the substance
for the shadow.
</p>

<p>
I had been a failure in every other walk of life, but
I made up my mind that I would not be a failure as
a lover.  Though I had failed in everything else, I
would not fail in my love for Fay.  Because I loved
her so much, I would sternly forego any possibility
of her ever loving me and spoiling her young life
thereby.  Then when the time came for her to be
awakened by the Fairy Prince who was somewhere
waiting for her, she would bless and thank me (if she
remembered me at all) for having left her free to
enjoy the happiness that was her due; while as for
me&mdash;well, it wouldn't much matter what became of
me, as long as Fay was happy.
</p>

<p>
Still I wished she wouldn't smile as if she saw
through my armour with those elfin eyes of hers.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly sounds of laughter came to us from the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go and see what's up," cried Fay, who never
could resist the sound of laughter.
</p>

<p>
So indoors she ran, with me after her, through the
garden door and down the passage into the great hall.
And there a strange sight met our eyes.
</p>

<p>
Frank, attired&mdash;in addition to his own ordinary
garments&mdash;in one of St. Etheldreda's flannel petticoats
and St. James's calico shirts, and with a baby's
knitted bonnet on the top of his curly hair, was
dancing a break-down in the middle of the hall, whilst
Annabel and Ponty and the assistant housemaid were
holding their sides with laughter at the ridiculous
sight of him.
</p>

<p>
Quick as thought Fay donned another of St. Etheldreda's
scarlet petticoats, snatched a large
tartan shawl from some other parish heap of garments,
and started a sort of skirt-dance on her own account,
and her dancing was one of the loveliest things I have
ever seen.  As the scarlet petticoat twirled round and
round, and the tartan shawl wound and unwound itself
round her slight figure, she seemed the very
embodiment of youth and jollity&mdash;the living "goddess of
heart-easing mirth."  It made me feel young even to
look at her, so full of life and joy and youth was she!
</p>

<p>
Then she and Frank began a wild dance together,
like a pair of leaves blown by the wind.  To and fro
they danced as light as air and as bright as flame,
flying apart and rushing together till one hardly could
tell which was which, while the old hall rang with the
laughter and applause of the onlookers, until at
last&mdash;after a final whirl in which their twinkling feet seemed
hardly to touch the ground at all&mdash;they sank down upon
the floor breathless with laughter and excitement.
</p>

<p>
My heart beat so fast that I couldn't speak: the
sight of their wonderful dancing had gone to my head
like wine, but Annabel was differently affected.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, you silly children," she said, wiping the
tears of laughter from her eyes; "I never saw such a
wild pair as you are in my life!  But you must take
off the Guild garments now and put them back in their
proper heaps, or else we shall never get all the things
sorted and packed in bundles."
</p>

<p>
I went out of the hall and down the passage to the
library, the dance had affected me more than I would
allow anybody to see.  It had made me feel young
again, and I knew that young was what I must never&mdash;for
Fay's sake&mdash;allow myself to feel.  If I did it
might weaken my resolve to play the role of the devout
lover.
</p>

<p>
"What a wonderful thing Youth is!" I said to
myself.  "Nothing but Youth could have danced
such a dance as that."  And then I tried to imagine
Annabel and myself dressed up in Guild garments and
springing about the old hall till the world grew young
again; but even my imagination&mdash;which is generally
supposed to be fairly rosy&mdash;bucked at this.  Such a
thing was unimaginable.
</p>

<p>
"No," I added, with a sigh, "I was quite right.
Miracles do happen nowadays, but not that particular one:
there is no setting the dial ten degrees backward."

CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
THE GIFT
</h3>

<p>
"I am afraid Fay is very ill: Dr. Jeffson is most
anxious about her," said Annabel to me, as I came
in rather late for luncheon one foggy November day.
I had been busy all morning looking after various
matters on the estate, as I had spent the three
preceding days in London, and work at home had
accumulated in my absence.
</p>

<p>
My heart stood still for a second, as hearts have a
habit of doing at the sudden announcement of bad
news, and a cold wave of sick misery seemed to engulf
me.  Then out of the engulfing wave I heard my voice
saying: "What is the matter with her? I saw her
just before I went to town, and then she had nothing
but a slight cold."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't slight at all, Reggie; it was a very heavy
cold, and she, being young and foolish, didn't take
proper care of it, with the consequence that it went
from her chest down to her lungs, and now she is in
for a sharp attack of pneumonia."
</p>

<p>
I sat down at the luncheon-table, but I could not
eat anything.  Noonday had turned to darkness
because Fay was ill.  "She didn't seem ill a few days
ago, when she went for a walk with me," I persisted;
"she had only a little cough."
</p>

<p>
"It was a nasty cough, Reggie, a very nasty cough.
I wonder that you took her for a walk with it."
</p>

<p>
An agony of remorse overwhelmed my soul.  What
a fool I had been!  What a fool I always was!
Whatever I did invariably turned out to be wrong.  "I
shall never forgive myself for doing so," I groaned;
"I deserve to be shot for such crazy idiocy and
selfishness.  But she said she was all right, and I was ass
enough to believe her."
</p>

<p>
Annabel, as usual, stood between me and the
consequences of my folly.  "It wasn't your fault,
Reggie: the girl is old enough to take care of herself.
I really don't see how a bachelor of forty-two can be
expected to watch all the symptoms of a young girl's
cold.  You aren't a nurse."
</p>

<p>
But I refused to be comforted.  "I was a fool&mdash;as
I am always, a selfish, incompetent fool!  I wanted
her to go for a walk with me, and it never occurred to
me to doubt that she wanted it too.  But Fay is so
unselfish, she would never think of herself where
anybody else's pleasure was concerned."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it was unselfishness on her part,
Reggie; it was simply youthful recklessness.  Young
people are always so careless about their health, and
if you try to consider them it only makes them worse.
I remember once, years ago, going for a round of calls
and ringing all the bells myself, because the
footman had such a bad cold I didn't think he ought
to ride on the box of the carriage, and when I got
home I found he'd spent the afternoon at a football
match!"
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell me as soon as I got home last
night?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I didn't know.  I went to the Rectory
this morning about some parish affairs, and then
Arthur told me.  He has sent for Frank to come from
Oxford, and they are both in a terrible state about
Fay.  It was really sad to see Frank.  What an
affectionate nature that boy has!  I do feel for him.
It is wretched for him to have his sister so ill."
</p>

<p>
"It is far more wretched for her," I said shortly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that," replied Annabel, as if
in a way she blamed Fay for causing Frank this mental
discomfort.  My sister was one of those women who
would always sacrifice a woman to a man.  Her
philosophy of life consisted in the theory that women
must work, and men must never on any account be
allowed to weep.  If they were, the women were in
some way to blame.
</p>

<p>
I got up from the table, pushing my untasted plate
away from me.  "I am going across to the Rectory
to see how she is now."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Reggie, don't be silly and make yourself ill
by eating no lunch.  If you make yourself ill it won't
make Fay any better, as two blacks never make a
white."
</p>

<p>
"It is all my fault that she is ill.  If I hadn't been
such an arrant fool her cold wouldn't have got to this
pitch," I said savagely.
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked at me with the placidity which had
soothed me all my life.  "You needn't blame yourself,
Reggie, you really needn't.  I wish to goodness I'd
never mentioned that walk!  It might have been wiser
it you had taken Frank instead of Fay, perhaps, and
would have been equally cheerful for you; but if Fay
herself didn't suggest it, I don't see that you were
called upon to think of it.  When I was Fay's age I
was quite capable of taking care of my own colds, and
so ought she to be.  Though I must say in my young
days young people had more stamina than they have
now, and wouldn't have thought of letting a cold fly
to their lungs in this hurried fashion.  In my time a
cold began in the head and went down to the throat,
and then on to the chest, and only got to the lungs
as a last resort&mdash;and not that, unless it was neglected.
The ordinary cold never went to the lungs at all."
</p>

<p>
Again I felt that Annabel was blaming Fay for
allowing herself to have been so rapidly overrun by
the invading enemy; so, as I could not bear to hear
my darling blamed without standing up for her, and
as I likewise couldn't bear to stand up against Annabel
for anybody, I went out of the room, banging the door
behind me.
</p>

<p>
Then followed an unspeakable time of heart-rending
anxiety.  The pneumonia spread, and all the efforts
of Jeffson and of a consultant from London to stop it
proved unavailing.  I found myself face to face with
the crushing and incredible blow of the death of a
dear one who was younger than myself.  The passing
onwards of our beloved must always be a sorrow to
us; but if they are older than ourselves, the sorrow
seems more or less a natural one.  But when they are
our juniors&mdash;and especially when they are considerably
our juniors&mdash;the agony becomes unnatural, even
monstrous.  It is against nature for the young ones
to be taken and the old ones to be left: an anguish
unbearable save to those blessed souls who have
grasped the great truth that death, after all, is only
a semicolon&mdash;not a full stop.
</p>

<p>
To me, during those dreadful days of Fay's illness,
the sun seemed to be turned into darkness and the
moon into blood; there was no light anywhere, and
I realised that if her sun went down while it was yet
day, there would be nothing henceforth for me but
dreary twilight until the dawn of the resurrection
morning.  Of course I prayed, but the heavens were
as brass above me: none answered, nor were there
any that regarded, and my soul went down into the
darkness and the shadow of death.
</p>

<p>
"Let us send for Mr. Henderson," I said to Arthur,
as soon as I knew how ill my darling was.  "If he
saved Frank, he could save her."
</p>

<p>
But Arthur shook his head.  "I thought of that,
and telephoned for him to come.  But I find he has
gone on a trip to the Holy Land, and will not be back
for weeks and weeks.  If he started back at once,
he would not be here in time to do anything for Fay,
and besides, they do not know exactly where to find
him."
</p>

<p>
So that hope was extinguished.
</p>

<p>
On the eighth day&mdash;to me it seemed the eighth
century&mdash;of Fay's illness, I awoke in the morning (if
one can call it waking when one hardly sleeps) with
certain words of Mr. Henderson's ringing in my ears;
words to which I had attached no importance at the
time, which I had never thought of since, but which
suddenly came back to me now with an emphasis
they had not borne at first.  The materialist, with his
deeper credulity and more unreasoning faith, would
put this phenomenon down to some strange and
inexplicable vagary on the part of my subconscious
self; but my simpler and less complex mind was
satisfied with the more obvious explanation that God
had, after all, heard my prayer, and had let my cry
come unto Him.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, but I think you have the gift of
healing," Henderson had said to me just as he was
leaving the Rectory, "utterly uncultivated and
undeveloped, but ready for Christ's use should He
need it."
</p>

<p>
And when I woke from my restless dozing on that
particular morning, those words of Mr. Henderson's
were ringing in my ears as plainly as if he had just
uttered them.
</p>

<p>
I dressed hurriedly, and without waiting for any
breakfast went straight to the Rectory to remind
Blathwayte of what Henderson had said.  It was too
early as yet for the doctor's visit, and the night-nurse
was still upon duty; but she had nothing good to
report, as Fay's temperature kept up and her strength
Was failing.
</p>

<p>
"Come and see," said Blathwayte, when I had
recalled Henderson's words to his mind.  "If he was
right, and you have the gift, you may save Fay's life
even yet."
</p>

<p>
And he took me into the sick-room, where the
shadow of my darling lay fighting for breath.
</p>

<p>
Then followed another of those experiences which
sound incredible in the telling, but which was so
natural&mdash;so inevitable&mdash;at the time, that it would
have been impossible for anything else to have
happened.
</p>

<p>
I knelt down by Fay's bed and laid my hand on
her burning forehead, and I lifted up my soul to God
in prayer, as I had never lifted it before.  As I prayed
I became conscious&mdash;as I had been when Frank seemed
dying&mdash;of a Presence in the room, the Presence of a
living Christ who was standing by my side so near
that I could almost feel His Touch&mdash;so real that I
felt if I opened my eyes I should see His Face.  And
with His coming all the sorrow and anxiety and
misery disappeared, and I knew that nothing could
ever really harm her or pluck her out of His Hand.
Fear vanished, because with Him beside me there was
nothing to fear: sorrow disappeared, because He
brought with Him fulness of joy: death stood at bay,
because He had conquered death.  There was nothing
any longer except Him, because in Him and through
Him and of Him are all things.  And I was conscious
not only of a profound peace in this Ineffable Presence:
I was conscious also of an inexhaustible power.  I
felt flowing into me, and through me into Fay, a sort
of wonderful electric current&mdash;a very elixir of life
itself&mdash;which I can describe as nothing but "the Power
from on High."  At that moment I felt that I had
the wings of eagles, and the strength of the angels that
excel.
</p>

<p>
How long I knelt I know not.  It was a moment
snatched from eternity, and therefore beyond the
measurements of time.  I realised that in His glorious
Presence there is neither past nor future, but only one
glorious, unending Now.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the Presence withdrew Itself, and the
rush of Power flowing through me subsided, and I
opened my eyes and looked at Fay.  The fever flush
in her cheeks was already fading, and the brow under
my hand grew cool and moist.  I rose from my knees
and told the nurse to take the temperature: she did
so, and found it rapidly subsiding.  The pulse, too,
was slower, and the breathing much easier.  By the
time that the doctor came he was able to say that the
crisis was past, and that the patient was on the way
to recovery.
</p>

<p>
Of course, both the doctor and the nurses were
amazed beyond words: they could not account for
such a sudden and unexpected turn for the better.
But I was not surprised.  I had been too recently in
the Presence of Christ to wonder at any manifestation
of His Power.  The wonder to me would have been
if Fay had not recovered.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
LOVE AMONG THE RUINS
</h3>

<p>
Fay recovered rapidly, to the surprise of the doctors
and the nurses, but not to mine.  After that ineffable
moment by what seemed to be her dying bed, I had
no further anxiety about her health.  I knew she was
going to be better and stronger than she had ever
been before.
</p>

<p>
But though I felt no anxiety on that account, I was
considerably worried on another.  I could not fail to
see that the fact that I had been used as God's
instrument in restoring my darling to health had greatly
exaggerated my importance in her eyes.  Although I
tried my utmost to convince her that it was all God's
doing and not mine in the least, I could not quell the
uprush of undeserved gratitude to me which filled her
dear heart.  Also, perhaps, the appeal of her weakness
loosened the armour of reserve which I had once
buckled on so tightly, and, strive as I might, I could
no longer keep my love for her out of my eyes and
voice.  It would work through, in spite of all my
efforts to suppress it.
</p>

<p>
I knew by now that Fay loved me: I knew that she
knew that I loved her.  Then what was I to do?
</p>

<p>
I could never be grateful enough to God that He
had used me as His instrument in bringing my Beloved
back to life and health, but of what avail would
that restored life be to her if I marred it by allowing
her to mate the fulness of her youth with crabbed age?
Should I, who had been granted, under God, the
inestimable blessing of saving her life, be the one to
spoil it for her?  Was it for me to mar what I had
been permitted to make: to destroy what I had been
allowed to restore?
</p>

<p>
Yet how I loved her!  Only God and my own soul
knew how I loved her!  Surely no young man, however
worthier of her he might be in every other respect,
could ever love her as much as I did.
</p>

<p>
In my perplexity I consulted Arthur.  The advice
of my parish priest&mdash;or, as the Prayer Book puts it,
of any discreet and learned minister&mdash;ought to be of
help to me in a perplexity such as this.  Being a
clergyman, Arthur would know so much more about
human nature than I knew; for then&mdash;as always&mdash;I
had no confidence in my own judgment.
</p>

<p>
I put the case to Blathwayte as tersely as I could,
begging him not to allow his friendship for me to lure
him into setting my happiness before my duty.
</p>

<p>
"I am not thinking about your happiness," he replied
in his blunt way, "I'm thinking about Fay's."
</p>

<p>
"That is all I try to think about," I said, "and that
is why I have appealed to you.  But I see, old man,
you agree with me that I have no right to set my
happiness before hers by asking her to marry me and
link her young life with mine."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly don't think you have any right to
sacrifice Fay's happiness to your own."
</p>

<p>
"Then that settles it," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Or to a false idea of what your conscience conceives
to be your duty," he went on, as if I had not
spoken.
</p>

<p>
This gave me pause.  "How do you mean?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that if you love Fay, as I know you do,
and if she loves you, as I believe she does, you have
no right to throw away this good and perfect gift for
the sake of some home-made scruple of yours.  I
mean that you are not justified in spoiling Fay's life,
even for the pleasure of spoiling your own at the same
time.
</p>

<p>
"Then what should you advise me to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I should advise you to tell Fay that you love her
and to ask her to marry you, and to abide by her
decision whatever it is."
</p>

<p>
"But she is so young," I pleaded&mdash;against my own
cause.
</p>

<p>
"If she is old enough to receive the gift of a good
man's love, she is old enough to know she has received
it, and to thank Heaven fasting for it."
</p>

<p>
"But I am so old&mdash;compared with her."
</p>

<p>
"That is her business&mdash;at least, so it seems to me,"
replied Blathwayte.  "If she thinks you are too old,
she can refuse you.  It is a thing that has been done.
But I do think that she is old enough to choose for
herself, and not to have things settled for her as if
she were a child or an imbecile.  She has plenty of
common sense."
</p>

<p>
"But I doubt if she is old enough and experienced
enough to choose in a thing like this.  It would break
my heart if she chose wrongly and regretted it
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"Hearts run the risk of getting broken in this
work-a-day world, and they had better run that risk than
remain wrapped up in cotton wool until they stifle and
suffocate.  If you'll excuse my saying so, Reggie, you
are too fond of transferring personal responsibilities.
You let Miss Kingsnorth make up your mind for you,
and in return you propose to make up Fay's.  For
my part, I think it is best for people to make up their
own minds, and to be prepared to take the
consequences.  It is in acting for oneself and in bearing
the consequences of one's actions that the education
of life consists, also the saving dogma of Free Will."
</p>

<p>
Thus inspired by Arthur I was tempted to put my
scruples on one side and my fate to the test; but even
yet I was haunted by doubts as to whether my doing
so would be fair to Fay.  I gave Arthur's counsel the
consideration that it deserved: as a clergyman he was,
so to speak, a specialist in the diagnosis of right and
wrong, and also in all matters connected with the
human soul.  But&mdash;when all was said and done&mdash;he
was a man and not a woman, and no episcopal laying
on of hands can convey the power rightly to discern
the workings of the female heart.  So I decided that
the person to help and advise me was not Blathwayte
at all, but Annabel, as she was a woman herself and
therefore the best judge as to how a woman would feel.
I felt that my sister would necessarily understand
Fay far better than either Arthur or I could.  So I
took Annabel into my confidence.
</p>

<p>
She listened to me carefully and sympathetically,
just as she used to listen to a category of my physical
symptoms when I was a little boy, and she feared I
had caught some childish complaint.
</p>

<p>
"I am not surprised," she said, when I had finished;
"I was afraid there would be some trouble of this
kind after Fay's most remarkable recovery and your
queer part in it."  Annabel was one of the people
who would always describe any direct answer to
prayer as "remarkable."  But "no offence meant,"
as the servants say.  She absolutely believed in the
God of Revelation; she stringently urged the imperative
duty of prayer; yet when any obvious connection
displayed itself between the human request and the
Divine Response, she at once relegated the phenomenon
to the realm of accidental coincidence, if not to
that of hysterical imagination.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't describe it exactly as 'trouble,'" I
remonstrated.
</p>

<p>
"I felt sure you'd fall in love with her, as you call
it after her recovery seemed to be the result of your
praying for her.  Any man would," continued my
sister, just in the same tone as thirty years ago she
would have said, "I felt sure you would catch measles
after having been exposed to the infection.  Any child
would."  Evidently, now as then, Annabel pitied
rather than blamed me.  Her blame would be reserved
for those who had exposed me to the infection.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not asking you why I fell in love with her,
Annabel; I shouldn't be such an ass as to ask that.
If you can tell me the reason why any man falls in
love with any woman, you have solved the riddle of
the ages.  The Sphinx herself could not baffle you."
</p>

<p>
"The reason is generally looks or money," replied
the undaunted Annabel.
</p>

<p>
"The reason for marriage, perhaps, but not for
falling in love.  Love is beyond all reason, or it
wouldn't be love."
</p>

<p>
"Then what are you asking me?  How you can get
over it?"
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, no!" I cried.  "I shall never 'get
over it,' as you say, and I never want to.  What I am
asking you is, do you think I am justified in asking
Fay to marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"I am very pleased you have consulted me in this
way, Reggie, very much pleased indeed.  It shows a
very proper feeling on your part, and is a fresh proof
of your unchanging affection for me, and of your
confidence in my judgment.  As I have told you, I have
seen this coming on ever since Fay took that
remarkable turn for the better, and I have tried to face it
in the proper spirit."
</p>

<p>
"And so you will," I exclaimed.  "I have never
known anything happen that you haven't faced in the
proper spirit."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked pleased.  "Of course, Reggie, I
cannot deny that it is a bit of a shock to me&mdash;especially
after all these years; but on the other hand
papa always wished you to marry, and it does seem a
pity for the title to die out.  I try to look at the matter
from all sides."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," I said impatiently, getting up from my
seat and walking about the great hall, where we had
been sitting in the firelight after tea.  "But what we are
discussing now is not whether I am justified in marrying
at all, but whether I am justified in marrying Fay."
</p>

<p>
Annabel shook her head.  "That is what I am not
sure about.  I wish to look at the question
dispassionately, but I very much doubt if you are."
</p>

<p>
My heart fell fathoms deep; yet I felt how wise I
had been to consult Annabel before speaking to Fay.
Arthur, looking at the matter from the man's point
of view, did not see the injustice of tying a young
woman to an old man; but Annabel, looking at it from
the woman's standpoint, evidently did.
</p>

<p>
"She is so young," I said.
</p>

<p>
"And so inexperienced," my sister added.
</p>

<p>
"That is what I feel.  She has seen no society of
her own class, except Blathwayte and ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, Reggie, and nothing but good society
teaches a girl <i>savoir faire</i>.  Of course, even a girl as
young as Fay who had seen more of the world would
be different; but she came here straight out of the
schoolroom."
</p>

<p>
How well Annabel understood, I thought to myself,
and how exactly she looked at the matter from my
point of view!  She really was a wonderful woman.
"Then you think even at her age&mdash;if she had seen
more of the world and had had more experience of
life&mdash;I might have asked her to marry me without
making a mistake which would spoil both our lives?"
</p>

<p>
"I do indeed, Reggie.  But as it is she is so very
ignorant and unsophisticated."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, which I filled up by spoiling my
right boot through poking the fire with it.  Then
Annabel said, apparently à propos of nothing: "Fay
hasn't any money&mdash;at least, not any to speak of."
</p>

<p>
How well my sister read my thoughts, I said to
myself.  It was Fay's lack of wealth&mdash;if she did not
marry me&mdash;that weighed on my mind.  Wildacre had
left his children about eight hundred a year apiece,
but that was not enough to keep my darling as she
ought to be kept.  Still I admit I was surprised that
this should have occurred to Annabel.
</p>

<p>
"But anyhow you have enough," she went on.
"Papa left an adequate fortune to endow a
baronetage."
</p>

<p>
I admitted he did, though I could not see what on
earth that had to do with the question.  "Still, I
couldn't share it with Fay unless she were my wife,"
I added.
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked puzzled.  "Of course not.  Whoever
suggested such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you did."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, no! such an absurd idea never
entered my head.  I was only thinking about your
marrying Fay."
</p>

<p>
"I spoke to Arthur on the matter, as he is Fay's
guardian," I continued, "and also my own parish
priest."
</p>

<p>
"It was quite right to consult him as Fay's
guardian, but I do not see what being a parish priest,
as you call it, has to do with the question.  And I
must say I very much hope, Reggie, that you did not
use that ridiculous expression in speaking to Arthur.
He is too much inclined to Romanism as it is, and
expressions like that are apt to give him false and
popish notions of his own importance."
</p>

<p>
"And he said," I went on, "that I ought to tell
Fay that I love her, and to let the decision of
accepting or refusing me lie with her."
</p>

<p>
"What ridiculous advice!  Of course she would
accept you at once."
</p>

<p>
Again I was grateful to Annabel for seeing my
darling as I saw her.  She evidently realised, as I did,
that Fay was far too unselfish to consider her own
happiness in comparison with mine.  If Fay knew I
loved her, she would accept me, whatever the sacrifice
to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Then you think Arthur was wrong?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely.  He nearly always is when he acts or
speaks on his own judgment, though in other respects
he is a most excellent man, and one for whom I have
the greatest regard.  But he is like you, Reggie, in
requiring some one at his elbow to give him good
advice, though I do not think he is always as ready
as you are to follow it."
</p>

<p>
My heart felt like lead.  "And you think I am not
justified in asking a girl of eighteen to marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  How can there be any real and
satisfactory companionship between a girl of that age
and a man of yours!"
</p>

<p>
I made one final appeal for happiness.  "Not even
if they love each other very much?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what that has to do with it.  Parents
love their children very much, but that doesn't
prevent them from looking at things from the different
points of view of their different generations.  And it
is natural that they should.  I am sure I loved papa
very much, but we did not see eye to eye in heaps of
things, because the ideas of his generation were quite
different from the ideas of ours.  He was very narrow
in some things.  But differences which are quite
allowable between parents and children seem to me
to be unnatural between a husband and wife, and even
more aggravating."
</p>

<p>
"Then that finally settles the matter," I said, walking
out of the hall to the library, for fear that even
the subdued glow of the firelight should reveal the
misery that I knew must be written on my face.
Arthur had opened the door of hope to me just a little;
but Annabel had firmly shut it again, and naturally
I was more influenced by Annabel than by
Arthur&mdash;especially as her opinion coincided with my
own.
</p>

<p>
But the matter was not finally closed after all.
</p>

<p>
After two bitter-sweet days&mdash;days when the happiness
of my short visits to Fay was clouded by the iron
self-restraint I was forced to exercise in her dear
presence, and when love and duty waged their mortal
combat in my soul&mdash;Annabel came to me as I was
smoking in the library.  She had just returned from
the Rectory, and I noticed that the wintry wind must
have caught her eyes, they looked so red and swollen.
There certainly was a bitter wind that day.
</p>

<p>
"I have been talking to Arthur," she abruptly began,
standing in front of the table and resting her two
hands upon it, "and I have come to the conclusion
that he was right and I was wrong."
</p>

<p>
I was surprised.  It was so very unlike Annabel to
own that she had been wrong about anything, I feared
she must be ill.
</p>

<p>
"But it really was not altogether my fault," she
continued; "it really was yours in not making things
plainer to me."
</p>

<p>
I felt relieved: there was evidently nothing serious
the matter with my sister.  It was absolutely normal
for things to be my fault and not hers.  Annabel was
herself again.
</p>

<p>
"What things didn't I make plain?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't make it plain to me how much your
feelings were involved in this sort of affair with Fay
Wildacre."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear girl, I told you that I wanted to
marry Fay, and what better proof could I have given
you of the depth of my feelings for her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you said you wanted to marry her, but
I didn't understand that you cared for her as much
as Arthur says you do," persisted Annabel, as if asking
for a woman's hand in marriage was merely a sign
of transitory admiration, such as asking for her hand
in a dance.  "Of course, that makes all the difference."
</p>

<p>
"All what difference?" I asked in bewilderment.
"I am no orator as Blathwayte is, and therefore I
cannot express my feelings as he seems able to express
them; but I wish you to be under no delusion as to
the state of my feelings towards Fay.  To me she is
and always will be the only woman I could possibly
marry&mdash;the only woman with whom I could ever fall
in love.  I love her to the very depths of my being
and always shall, and it is because I love her so much
that I refuse to take my happiness at the expense of
hers, and to tie her for life to a man old enough to
be her father.  There now, you have it.  If I wasn't
clear enough before, surely I am now."
</p>

<p>
"That's you all over, Reggie, always ready to
sacrifice yourself to other people!  I never knew
anybody as absolutely unselfish as you are&mdash;except, of
course, mamma."
</p>

<p>
I was astonished, and showed it.  "But you agreed
with me, Annabel.  You said it wouldn't be fair to
Fay to ask her to marry me."
</p>

<p>
It was now Annabel's turn to look surprised.
"What nonsense, Reggie!  I don't know what you
are talking about."
</p>

<p>
"You said I was too old to make her happy."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't possibly have ever said anything so
utterly idiotic.  You must be going off your head!
Why, I think that to marry you would be the greatest
happiness any woman could possibly have, and
I don't believe that any woman living is worthy
of it."
</p>

<p>
This, of course, was ridiculous sisterly exaggeration,
and needed nipping in the bud.  But I was too busy just
then thinking about Fay to have time to nip Annabel.
"You said I was too old for her," I persisted.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't.  I said she was too young for you, which
is quite a different thing.  But I'll withdraw even that
if you think she is necessary to your happiness."
</p>

<p>
"There is no doubt of that.  The only question that
matters is whether I am necessary to hers."
</p>

<p>
Annabel smiled her old, indulgent smile.  "Oh,
Reggie, how absurd you are.  You don't seem to
realise that the woman who marries you will be the
luckiest woman on the face of the earth.  And you
really ought to marry; papa would have wished it;
I am sure it would have been a dreadful disappointment
to him if the baronetcy had died out.  He had
great ideas of founding a family."
</p>

<p>
"He would have adored Fay.  I wish he could have
lived to see her," I said softly, so softly that Annabel
did not hear me.
</p>

<p>
"I know papa would have been pleased at your
marrying; it is a great support to me to feel sure of
that.  But the thing that I care most for is your
happiness, Reggie; I could never bear to feel that any
words of mine have ever stood between you and your
heart's desire, and if you feel certain that Fay will
make you happy, by all means ask her to marry you."
</p>

<p>
"I do feel certain of that.  She will make me
happier than my wildest dreams."
</p>

<p>
Annabel turned to leave the room.  "Had I been in
your place," she remarked thoughtfully, "I should
have selected a woman of my own age who would have
known how to manage a large household and would
have been an agreeable and sympathetic companion,
looking at life from my own standpoint.  But people
know their own business best.  And of course there
are other considerations," she added, opening the
door.  "There's something to everything," she
concluded, summing up with one terse and enigmatical
sentence the great law of compensation as she closed
the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Annabel left me I rushed across to the
Rectory.  Now that my sister had gone over to the
beneficent enemy, and had joined forces against my
struggle to do what I considered to be my duty at the
cost of what I knew to be my happiness, there was no
more fight left in me.  I capitulated at once, and
decided to follow Blathwayte's advice and leave the
matter in my darling's hands.  She was my queen,
and it was for her to rule and order my fate.
</p>

<p>
I found her, as usual, lying on a chintz-covered sofa
by the fire in the beautifully proportioned drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you have come," said Fay, after I
had greeted her and sat down beside her sofa.  "You
are one of the tiresome people who make things
dreadfully dull by not being there."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I replied, "or rather, I'm glad."
</p>

<p>
"You have spoilt a lot of pleasure for me in that
way," Fay continued, "and I find it rather hard to
forgive you.  I used to enjoy myself always, and now
I only enjoy myself when you are about.  It proves
you have a rather narrowing influence, don't you
think?"
</p>

<p>
"It does seem to point that way," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"And not an influence that makes for universal
happiness, either, Sir Reggie," Fay went on.  "As
you can only be in one place at once, there can only
be one cheerful place in the world at a time, while
the number of places you can't be at is unlimited,
therefore the number of places you make miserable
are unlimited.  I've come to the conclusion that the
really benevolent people are those who make a hell of
whatever place they are in, and a heaven of every
other place because they aren't in it.  When you come
to think of it, the amount of joy that these people
scatter about is simply enormous.  Think of the
countless little heavens below that they create!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a beautiful thought, and shows how <i>nous
autres</i> ought to follow their example.  I say <i>nous
autres</i> advisedly, as you are made on the same lines
as I am&mdash;at least, as you say I am.  In fact, I regret
to state that I never met anybody who had the knack
of creating&mdash;by your mere absence&mdash;such illimitable
and chaotic blanks as you do."
</p>

<p>
I loved talking nonsense with Fay.  As a matter of
fact I have always loved talking nonsense.  I belong
to the generation to which nonsense appeals.  The
past generation is too serious for it, and the rising
generation is too strenuous: it was the prerogative
of the last quarter of the nineteenth century to bring
nonsense to the level of a fine art.  And of all kinds
of nonsense, the nonsense which is at the same time
a curtain and a channel for love-making is to me the
most delightful.
</p>

<p>
When our parents made love, they discussed the
intellectual questions of the day; when their
grandchildren make love, they discuss the social problems
of theirs; but in the middle ages that came between
these two eras, love-making belonged neither to the
realm of mind nor to the realm of morals, but rather
to that of manners alone.  Of course, love was and is
the same in all ages&mdash;and in all centuries: it is eternal,
and therefore has nothing to do with time.  But the
art of love-making varies with each generation, and
every period has its own particular style.  I am quite
aware that by reason of her youth Fay had the right
to a lover who would discuss with her the origin of
Sex-antagonism or the economic relations of Capital
and Labour; but Annabel and Arthur robbed her of
that right when they overthrew my scruples and bade
me go forth to woo the woman that I loved.
</p>

<p>
"You make places much more loathsome by not
being there than I do," said Fay.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, that is the one subject on which I am
more competent to form a judgment than you are,
as you have never been into those abominations of
desolation where you are not present, and can
therefore form no idea of their ghastly vacuity.  But
consciousness of sin should result in amendment of
life, and now that we know our faults the next
question is how are we to cure them?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll cure yours first, Sir Reggie.  It seems to me
that all you have got to do is to go to all places and
parties that I go to, so that I shall never know how
horrible they would have been if you hadn't been
there.  Of course, if you could have been everywhere
at once it would have been best, as in that case there
would have been no dull parties or empty places&mdash;no
abominations of desolations, that is to say&mdash;for
anybody.  But that would be so difficult and trying for
you, as it is most fatiguing to be in even two places
at once.  Please notice what self-restraint I am
exercising in not quoting Sir Boyle Roche and his
bird.  Ninety-nine persons out of every hundred
would have done so at the present point of the
conversation."
</p>

<p>
"But you are always the hundredth," I explained.
</p>

<p>
"But not the Old Hundredth as yet! that is a
pleasure still to come."
</p>

<p>
"Not in my time," I said, and though I smiled
there was a sigh at the back of the smile.  How
glorious it would have been if I had been young too,
so that Fay and I might have grown old together!
But that could never be.
</p>

<p>
"So, as you can't be in two, much less in two
hundred places at once, the only thing is for you to
be in the same place as I am.  That will come to the
same thing, as far as I am concerned, and beyond that
I really cannot manage matters.  I have a most
provincial mind, and the world isn't my province, as
it was Bacon's or Shakspere's or somebody's.
Whoever it was, he must have been a very interfering
person if he acted up to his principles, which I expect
he didn't, as nobody does, except Miss Kingsnorth
and Mr. Blathwayte."
</p>

<p>
"They do," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't they, fearfully?"
</p>

<p>
I let this pass, as I was intent on other matters.
"But about curing this fault of mine," I went on;
"if one person can't always be in two places at once,
two people can always be in one place at once, and
that&mdash;as you remark&mdash;practically amounts to the same
thing in the long run.  That I could manage, I think&mdash;with,
of course, a little help from you.  And, strange
to say, it was about this arrangement that I came to
see you to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you came about something.  You hadn't the
loose-endy sort of a look you generally have."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of a look had I?"
</p>

<p>
Fay shrugged her shoulders airily.  "Oh, a 'life-is-real,
life-is-earnest,' and
'England-expects-every-man-this-day-to-do-his-duty'
sort of look.  But don't mind
my mentioning it.  It was rather a becoming look,
as a matter of fact, and nothing for you to worry
about."
</p>

<p>
I took the little hand that was lying over the edge
of the sofa.  "Fay, do you know what I came to
say?" I said softly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but all the same, I'd rather you said it.  I
shan't take it as read."
</p>

<p>
"It is so hard for me to put into words."
</p>

<p>
"But so nice for me to hear the words into which
it is put."
</p>

<p>
"You vain child!" I whispered, stroking her curly
hair.
</p>

<p>
The lovely eyes lifted to mine were full of laughter.
But there was something in them behind the laughter&mdash;that
something which for weeks and weeks I had
been trying so hard not to see.  "If I'm vain, you are
idle; so one is as bad as the other."
</p>

<p>
There were a few seconds of silence, then Fay said:
"Go on, I'm waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, it is no good my telling you that I
love you, for you know that already.  And it is no
good my attempting to tell you how much I love you,
because I could never do that if I talked from now
till doomsday."
</p>

<p>
"Still, it wouldn't be a bad way of passing the time
from now till then," Fay remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll pass it so, my darling," I said, kneeling
down beside her sofa and taking her in my arms, "and
eternity shall be passed in the same way, after
doomsday is over.  And even then I shan't have half told
you how much I love you."  And I kissed her full on
the lips, and for the first time in my life knew the
ecstasy of human love.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes of blissful silence, Fay
remarked: "If <i>I</i> try to tell <i>you</i> how much I love you, I
shall have my work cut out for me too; and if I have
to do it between now and doomsday it will take me all
I know to get it done in the time."
</p>

<p>
"Do you love me so very much, my little Fay?"
</p>

<p>
"Frightfully much, ridiculously much, far, far more
than you deserve."
</p>

<p>
"But I am so old, sweetheart&mdash;so much too old for
you.  That is what is worrying me."
</p>

<p>
Fay cuddled up to me, laughing contentedly.  "I
know.  I have watched it worrying you for ages.  I
have seen you for months now trying to work out a
sum that if you take away eighteen from forty-two
nothing remains, and you couldn't get it right."
</p>

<p>
"Still nothing did remain when there seemed a
chance of eighteen being taken away from forty-two;
absolutely nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
Fay laughed again, a little gurgling laugh of pure
delight.  "How dreadfully clever you are!  If you
go on being as clever as that you'll have a headache,
or softening of the brain, or something of that kind.
You make me quite anxious about you."
</p>

<p>
"But though I know that if eighteen were taken
away from forty-two nothing could remain&mdash;at least,
nothing that would make life worth living&mdash;I still can't
make forty-two equal to eighteen.  Eighteen is so
much more than forty-two in every dimension that
matters&mdash;in youth and health and joy and vigour and
everything else that counts."
</p>

<p>
"Your language is charming, Sir Reggie, but your
arithmetic leaves much to be desired."
</p>

<p>
"Sir me no sirs, if you love me.  Reggie, plain
Reggie, an' it please you.  But, sweetheart, I have
been struggling for months not to let you know that
I love you, as I felt it was not fair to ask a young
girl like you to marry a stuffy old fogey like me."
</p>

<p>
"Very thoughtful of you!  As I said, I have noticed
concealment like a worm i' the bud feeding on your
damask cheek for some time, but it didn't bluff me.
When did you fall in love with me?"
</p>

<p>
"The first moment that I saw you."
</p>

<p>
Fay nodded her head&mdash;as well as circumstances
would permit it.  "I'm not surprised.  That large
black hat is very becoming."
</p>

<p>
"And when did you fall in love with me, my
darling?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not the first moment that I saw you."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "I didn't expect you would."
</p>

<p>
"Long, long before that: from Frankie's description
of you."
</p>

<p>
My face fell.  "Oh, sweetheart, what a horrid way
of falling in love."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't horrid at all, silly&mdash;and anyway it was
my way.  From Frankie's letters I had built up a
sort of combination of King Arthur and Sir Philip
Sidney and Henry Esmond and the Scarlet Pimpernel,
and had called it You and fallen in love with it.  And
of course I felt sure that when I met you you would
fall far short of what I had imagined, and so the rest
of my life would be one bitter regret and longing for
a lost ideal.  You know the sort of thing: just what
a girl would thoroughly enjoy.  And then when I got
to know the real You, you were so much nicer than
anything I had ever imagined that all my unfulfilled
plans were quite upset.  And so instead of breaking
my heart, as I had intended, I lost it."
</p>

<p>
"You darling!" I whispered, covering her pretty
curls with kisses.
</p>

<p>
"And now, since we are on the catechising task,
would you mind telling me what stopped concealment's
meal, and why your damask cheek was suddenly,
as you might say, 'off' the menu?" Fay
asked.
</p>

<p>
I told her the simple truth.  "Because both
Annabel and Arthur said that you had a right to know
that I loved you, and that it was for you to decide
whether I was too old for you."
</p>

<p>
Fay drew herself slightly out of my arms.  "How
very interfering of them!" she said shortly.
</p>

<p>
I hastened to explain.  "No, no, my darling, you
mustn't think that.  You will be doing them both a
grave injustice if you do.  I asked for their advice,
they would never have offered it otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"I can't see that it was any business of theirs."
</p>

<p>
"But of course it was," I urged; I could not bear
for there to be any misunderstanding between Fay
and Annabel.  "Don't you see, sweetheart, that it was
certainly Arthur's business, because your father
appointed him your guardian?  And Annabel has been
more than a sister&mdash;almost more than a mother&mdash;to
me, so that everything which concerns me is her business
<i>par excellence</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Fay.  But somehow&mdash;I do not know
why&mdash;a cloud seemed to have come over the full
sunshine of our new happiness.
</p>

<p>
"And they were right," I continued in further
exculpation of the two who, next to Fay, were dearest
to me in the world.  "It is owing to their advice that
I have dared to ask you to marry me.  Otherwise I
shouldn't have felt I was worthy to ask such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you haven't asked it&mdash;at least, not in my
hearing," laughed Fay, the sunshine breaking out once
more after the passing cloud.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest, will you marry me?"
</p>

<p>
Fay's answer was characteristic.  "Miss Wildacre
begs to thank Sir Reginald Kingsnorth for his kind
invitation, and has much pleasure in accepting it.
Oh no, that wasn't quite right.  Miss Wildacre begs
to thank Sir Reginald and Miss Kingsnorth for their
kind invitation, and has much pleasure in accepting it.
That is better."
</p>

<p>
It pleased me to find her coupling my sister's name
with mine in this fashion, and I approved her amendment.
I wanted her to recognise how much my marriage
meant to Annabel.
</p>

<p>
I sealed our compact with a kiss.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you really love me," said Fay.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Rather</i>!  But I am afraid it is 'Love among the
Ruins,' sweetheart: the ruins being represented by
Arthur and Annabel and myself."
</p>

<p>
Fay ran her fingers through my still bushy hair.
"Not ruins&mdash;not exactly ruins, my Reggie: say rather
ancient monuments in the most perfect state of
preservation."  And that was all the comfort she would
give me&mdash;at least, just then.
</p>

<p>
But after some further conversation, with no
reporter present, she looked up into my face and said:
"So Love has performed the miracle after all which
you said could never be performed again.  Love has
made us one at last, and has set the dial ten degrees
backward.  There is nothing between us now, Reggie&mdash;not
even those tiresome ten degrees."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
THINGS GREAT AND SMALL
</h3>

<p>
The time of our engagement was a very happy
time for me.  It was so heavenly to be continually
with Fay, and not to feel myself bound in honour to
dissemble my love.  And the more I saw of her the
more devotedly I loved her.  Surely there never was
anybody so gay and loving and light-hearted as she.
</p>

<p>
When Frank came down from Oxford at Christmas,
he added to the general hilarity, and welcomed me
as a brother with an unconscious condescension which
amused as much as it gratified me.  He, Fay and I,
formed a Triple Entente, from which everything that
appertained to middle age was excluded.  So that I
was not only happy for the first time in my life&mdash;I
was also young.
</p>

<p>
There was only one drawback to my perfect bliss&mdash;one
crumpled rose-leaf in my bed of roses, and that
was my consciousness of the fact that Fay and
Annabel did not appreciate one another as thoroughly
as I could have wished.  Of course I could see the
reasonableness&mdash;one might almost say the inevitableness&mdash;of
this.  In the first place, I could not disguise
it from myself that my marriage, even to any one
as completely adorable as Fay, was something of a
blow to Annabel, who had ruled so long and so
undisputedly over her family circle.  Ever since she had
been old enough to take the reins, she had taken
them and had grasped them firmly; neither I nor
my father before me had ever dared to lay so much
as a restraining finger on them: therefore it must
have been terribly hard for her to find herself
equalled&mdash;in some things even superseded&mdash;by a girl nearly
thirty years her junior.  It was not in human nature
to avoid, however silently, resenting this, and
Annabel, though one of the best and wisest
women that ever lived, was nevertheless quite
human.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, I could not fail to see that
Annabel's admirable behaviour in accepting the
situation as she did was utterly lost upon Fay.  Annabel
was really behaving splendidly, and Fay was totally
unconscious of it.  With (I am bound to admit it)
the hardness of youth, Fay was absolutely blind to
Annabel's suffering; but at the same time she was
quick to perceive and to resent any curtness of manner
or sharpness of speech which were really only the
outward symptoms of that suffering.  I own I was
disappointed at this, but it could not be helped, and
I decided in my own mind to make up to Annabel in
every way that I could for Fay's lack of appreciation,
of my sister's sacrifice, until the time came&mdash;as it
surely would come when they grew to know each other
better&mdash;when Fay would learn to love Annabel as I
loved her.  That Annabel would ever learn to love
Fay as I loved my darling was obviously beyond the
realms of possibility, for surely no human being ever
loved another as I loved Fay; but I felt sure that as
the child grew older and Annabel recognised the
beautiful and endearing qualities which were hidden
under the bewitchingly frivolous and off-hand manner,
she too would recognise Fay's charm and reverence
her character.  At any rate, I felt it would not be
my fault if these, my two dearest, failed eventually to
love and appreciate one another; for I meant to make
it the object of my life to bring them to a fuller mutual
understanding, and to enable each to see and admire
the good qualities of the other.
</p>

<p>
So I was confident that the one crumpled rose-leaf
would soon be ironed flat again, and that the one
tiny cloud was only a passing summer one.
</p>

<p>
There was another thing, too, which made me very
happy at that time, and filled my already brimming
cup of joy to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
One morning the wife of one of my labourers
stopped me in the village.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, Sir Reginald," said she, "but my boy,
Willie, has twisted his back, and the pain be
something fearful.  Something fearful it be."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for that, Mrs. Jackson," I said, "very
sorry indeed.  How did he do it?"
</p>

<p>
"By doin' what he ought not, Sir Reginald, him
bein' a boy and climbin' on to one of the big ricks
in the rick-yard and tumblin' off."
</p>

<p>
"Has Dr. Jeffson seen him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Reginald, that he has, but he don't seem
to know what to do to do him good.  And Willie has
taken it into his head that if you'd come and lay your
hands on him, like as you did on the young lady at
the Rectory, you'd stop the pain and make his
back all right again, if it wouldn't be too much
trouble."
</p>

<p>
This request naturally caused me some astonishment.
It had not occurred to me that my gift of healing
was a permanent possession.  I had imagined that
my earnest prayer to God and my intense love for
Fay had made me, for that one occasion, a channel
of the Divine Grace.  Then I remembered how St. Paul
had said that among the diverse gifts of the Spirit
of God one is the gift of healing; and how
Mr. Henderson&mdash;who undoubtedly had himself been endowed
with this gift&mdash;had said that he believed it had been
entrusted to me also.  Therefore I acceded to
Mrs. Jackson's request, and accompanied her to her cottage.
</p>

<p>
Willie was lying in the parlour on a horse-hair sofa,
groaning with pain.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my boy," I said, "I am sorry to hear you
have hurt yourself.  Is there anything that I can do
for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for comin' to see me, Sir Reginald,"
replied the child, pulling at his forelock in the absence
of a cap; "I feel sartain that if you'll lay your hands
on me, like as you did on Miss Wildacre when her
was so bad, I'll get rid o' this dreadful pain, and be
able to get about again."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do what I can, Willie," I said, sitting down
beside the sofa; "but you must remember that I cannot
cure you myself.  There is only one Person who can
cure you, and that is Christ.  I have no power&mdash;neither
has the doctor any power&mdash;except what Christ
gives us.  He may choose to cure you by means of the
doctor's medicine or by means of my prayers; but
whichever it may be, remember it is Christ's doing,
and not ours.  We are only the means that He chooses
to make use of."
</p>

<p>
"But some folks do seem to have what you might
call the gift o' healin', Sir Reginald," said Mrs. Jackson.
"My mother was a Scotchwoman, and she said
there was allus healin' in the touch of a seventh son.
Many and many a time has she seen it for herself,
and in the place where she came from folks 'ud send
all over the country for a seventh son if they was in
pain."
</p>

<p>
If Mrs. Jackson had said this to me a year earlier,
I should probably have laughed at it as an ignorant
superstition.  Now, I saw no improbability in it at all.
I have learnt that that is the way with many old wives'
tales: behind the superstition there lies a scientific
truth, but during the march of the centuries the truth
has been lost, while the superstition has remained.  For
instance, in many country places there is a tradition
that to carry a potato in one's pocket is a cure for
rheumatism, and modern medical science has discovered
that one of the best cures for rheumatic affections
is the juice of the potato.  Again, it was a superstition
of our great-grandmothers that if a cat sneezed
it was a premonition that colds were coming to all the
household; now we know that colds are infectious, and
can be caught from animals as well as from human
beings.  In the same way, doubtless, most of the
superstitions about plants had their origin in knowledge
of the medicinal properties of those plants, and the
old idea that a maid could make herself beautiful
by bathing her face in dew on a May morning was,
after all, nothing but a testimony to the beneficial
effects on the complexion of early rising and soft
water.
</p>

<p>
What the "seventh son" had to do with the matter&mdash;or
whether he had anything to do with it at all&mdash;I
do not pretend to say; but the tradition about him is
a proof that through all ages there have been certain
persons endowed with a soothing and a healing touch,
with a certain fulness of vitality which they could
impart to their fellow creatures.
</p>

<p>
Then one is faced by a difficulty as to how much
or this power is natural and how much is supernatural,
which to me is no difficulty at all, as I simply
decline to differentiate between the two.  To me
everything in life is natural because everything is
supernatural: there is really no difference.  The only
difference I can discover&mdash;which is, after all,
only a superficial one&mdash;is between the usual and the
unusual.
</p>

<p>
I have waded through countless books on the workings
of the subconscious mind&mdash;on the powers of the
subliminal self&mdash;on the depth of that mysterious thing
we call personality&mdash;until my faith has staggered
before the demands made upon it.  I found myself asked
to believe in impossibilities which would shake the
credulity of a child&mdash;to swallow camels which were
too huge for the most efficient digestion.  So I humbly
confessed that I had not sufficient faith to accept these
transcendental doctrines, and turned instead to the
older and simpler and more practical explanation of
natural and spiritual phenomena as set forth in the
Four Gospels.
</p>

<p>
I do not aspire to the transcendental knowledge of
the modern mystic, nor to the blind and childlike faith
of the pure materialist.  Such things are beyond me.
To me, it is as inconceivable that the soul should
save and satisfy itself out of its own fulness as that
the body should create and form itself out of the
floating atoms of a mechanical cosmos.  The only
satisfactory answer that I have ever found to the <i>Riddle of
the Universe</i> is the answer of the Living Christ.
St. Paul had prepared for himself a complete curriculum
of necessary knowledge when he said: "I am determined
to know nothing among you, save Jesus Christ
and Him crucified."
</p>

<p>
So in the question of healing; when one realises
that the only Healer is Christ, it becomes a mere
matter of detail whether He chooses to use as His
instrument the skill of a physician, the self-conquest
of the patient, or the power of a natural healer: just
as in old times it was a mere matter of detail whether
He anointed with clay the eyes of the blind, or laid
His hand on the sick person, or spake the word only.
It was not the hem of the garment that healed, it was
Christ Himself.  The hem was only the chosen channel
of His Divine Power.
</p>

<p>
I knelt down beside Willie Jackson's sofa, and laid
my hands upon him as I had laid them on Fay, at
the same time lifting up my soul in prayer that the
boy's pain might cease and his injury be cured.  Again
I felt the Blessed Presence in the room, and the
wonderful Power rushing through me, and when at last I
rose from my knees, Willie exclaimed that the pain
had gone.
</p>

<p>
And so it had for that day, but I had to lay my
hands upon him in prayer twice again before it
disappeared altogether, and the doctor pronounced him
perfectly cured.  Why this was I cannot explain, and
have never attempted to explain.  It was enough for
me&mdash;and quite enough for Willie&mdash;that in three days'
time he was absolutely well.  We left explanations to
those less simple souls who worship the Law rather
than the Law-Giver.
</p>

<p>
But my healing experiences did not end here.  Ponty,
who was a martyr to rheumatism, asked me to treat
her as I had treated Willie Jackson, which I did,
with marked success.  Her pain disappeared, and
her limbs grew much more supple.  Gradually it
became quite a custom in the village for any one in
pain or sickness to send for me, and I helped them
as far as I was able.  Sometimes my ministrations
were absolutely successful, sometimes only partially
so; but I do not think they ever failed to bring a
certain amount of relief to the sufferers.  Again I do
not attempt an explanation: I only know that it was
so.
</p>

<p>
People often ask me whether I consider this gift of
healing a natural or a spiritual gift.  My answer is
that there is no fundamental difference between the
two, since "every good gift and every perfect gift is
from above, and cometh down from the Father of
lights."  But of this I am sure, that it is not a gift
bestowed upon every one alike, and those who have
it not should not therefore conclude that they are
farther from the Kingdom of Heaven than are those
who have it.  We are expressly told that there are
diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit, and it is not
for us to choose which gift shall be ours.
</p>

<p>
I remember discussing this one day with Blathwayte
when we were walking home together from
rabbit shooting.
</p>

<p>
"Although I agree with you, Reggie," he said,
"that it saves a good deal of needless confusion when
once we realise that what we call the natural and the
supernatural are in reality one, and that the
distinction between them is purely artificial, that does
not explain why you are more successful at some
times than at others.  Christ's Power is always the
same."
</p>

<p>
"No, Arthur, it isn't, because He has chosen to
limit His Power by our faith.  Remember 'He could
do no mighty works there because of their unbelief.'  When
I fail, it may be that either I or my patient is
lacking in faith at the time."
</p>

<p>
Arthur nodded.  "That may be so.  Faith is
always the one condition that He imposes."
</p>

<p>
"And there may be another reason," I said slowly,
"though it is one which I find rather difficult to put
into words.  I think that we human beings are very
apt to confuse two things which in God's eyes are
essentially different: I mean Prayer and Magic.  They
are both mysterious connections with the Unseen
Powers through the mediums of a form of words, by
which we induce those Powers to act in accordance
with our own desires.  I think I may say without
injustice that most people who believe in either or
both of them regard them as a spiritual form of
wirepulling."
</p>

<p>
Arthur smiled.  "I fancy you are not far out there,
old man."
</p>

<p>
"I am not an authority on these matters," I continued;
"I am only airing my own perhaps worthless
opinions; but I do honestly believe that there is such
a thing as Magic, and that the earlier races of
mankind knew far more about it than we do; and by
Magic I mean the power to move or control by some
mysterious ritual the great forces of Nature."
</p>

<p>
"You believe that this really can be done?"
</p>

<p>
"I do.  Whether it is right to do it is another
matter, and one on which I do not feel competent to
express an opinion.  But that it can be done&mdash;and
has been done&mdash;I have no doubt whatsoever.  If
Man was made in the image of God, then surely some
of the power of God is inherent in him, even if he
does not know how to wield it properly.  My only
doubt is whether it is safe for him to try to wield it,
as long as his ignorance of it is as great as it is in the
present stage of human history."
</p>

<p>
"They knew more about it in ancient Egypt,"
Arthur said.
</p>

<p>
"And in earlier civilisations even than that," I
added.  "I believe that in those far-away days men
practised the rites and the mysteries which brought
them into contact with, and by which they controlled
to some extent, the Principalities and Powers of the
vast universe which for want of a better word we call
Nature.  Then Man&mdash;as is unfortunately his habit&mdash;fell
away from his first estate, and began to worship
the Principalities and the Powers instead of the God
who made him and them, and then God drew a veil
between Man and the Great Powers, so that Man
should not be tempted by knowing them to worship
them.  And that is where we are at present.  But
even now the veil sometimes wears thin in places,
and some stray mortal peeps through and catches
faint glimpses of the glories and the grandeurs on the
other side."
</p>

<p>
"Then you do not believe that Pan is dead?" said
Arthur.
</p>

<p>
"No more dead than anybody else is dead," I
answered, "only separated from us, like all the other
so-called dead people, until we are sufficiently
advanced in our spiritual life to meet them again.
That is really all that death amounts to, when you
look it in the face."
</p>

<p>
"That is so," said Blathwayte in that quiet voice
so right.
</p>

<p>
"I love to think of those early days," I went on,
waxing garrulous and tiresome, as I always do when
I get on to this subject, "when Man was conversant
with the great forces of Nature; when he saw white
presences among the hills, and heard the message of
the whirlwind and the fire, and took his part in the
chantings of the morning stars.  It was only when
he began to worship these that the evil came.  They
were but the choirs and the servers and the acolytes
in the vast temple of his God, and he did evil when
he fell down and worshipped them.  It was then that
the veil of the temple was let down between them
and him."
</p>

<p>
"And will it soon be lifted again, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be rent in twain when Man is once more
in absolute harmony with the Infinite.  Don't you
remember that in St. John's vision of the Throne, in
addition to the Spirits and the Elders, there were four
Beasts full of eyes, each with six wings?  I believe
that these six-winged Beasts&mdash;which Isaiah speaks of
as Seraphim&mdash;are the great forces of Nature, the
Powers of wind and water and earth and fire: those
Powers which the ancients set up as gods and
worshipped."
</p>

<p>
"Then you believe in the old gods?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "Not as gods, but as great
forces; Man's initial error lay in treating them as
gods."
</p>

<p>
"And you believe that these strange Beings&mdash;these
Principalities and Powers&mdash;are not of evil?" asked
Arthur.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, they are wholly of good when
put in their proper places, and regarded not as Man's
masters, but as Man's fellow-worshippers of the Most
High.  They rest not day or night, crying, 'Holy,
Holy, Holy'; but Man is at present so stupid that
he hasn't ears to hear their <i>Sanctus</i>."
</p>

<p>
Arthur was silent for a moment, then he said: "I
like these ideas of yours, Reggie; they blow through
one's dusty, stereotyped notions like a strong wind
from the mountains.  That is a fine conception of
yours of a temple where the choristers are the
constellations, and the acolytes the powers of the air.
It makes one feel that the universe is so big and wide.
But I don't quite see how all this explains your
original proposition that Magic must not be
confounded with Prayer."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I said; "I fear I am generally more
or less of a wandering sheep where conversation is
concerned.  But what I mean&mdash;to put it tersely&mdash;is
that Magic is more or less of a command, while Prayer
altogether is a supplication.  Both involve a mystical
communion with an unseen Power; but while we may
command the lesser Powers, we can do nothing but
abase ourselves before the Highest Power of all."
</p>

<p>
"I see your point," said Arthur.  "Since Magic is,
so to speak, more or less mechanical, certain results
must necessarily follow certain rituals; but with
Prayer the final result lies with the Power to whom
the request is made, and is therefore what one might
call optional."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  And I believe the reason why Prayer
is not invariably answered at once&mdash;and not always
in the way we expect&mdash;is to teach us that we are not
controlling a spiritual force but are supplicating a
living Person; therefore the final decision lies with
Him and not with us, and we must be content to leave
it there.  If, by uttering certain words and performing
certain ceremonies, I was invariably able to heal
a patient, I should be healing by Magic, a thing, mind
you, which has been done&mdash;and possibly still is done&mdash;in
the history of the world; but if I lay what natural
and spiritual gifts I may possess at the patient's
service, and leave the result in Christ's hands, then
Christ does what He thinks fit in His love and His
own way.  In dealing with a Person one must allow
for the Personal Equation, even though that Person
be our Lord Himself."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear you say this," said Blathwayte
as we parted, "as I was afraid that the idea of
Magic&mdash;in conjunction with the healing powers which you
undoubtedly possess&mdash;might get hold of a man of your
peculiar temperament.  But you seem to look at it
as simply and naturally as Henderson does."
</p>

<p>
A few days after this conversation with Arthur,
Annabel startled me by suddenly coming into the
library, and saying without any preamble, as she
stood beside my chair at the writing-table: "Where
do you think I had better take a house,
Reggie? somewhere near here or in London?"
</p>

<p>
"Take a house?  What on earth do you mean?"
I asked in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must live somewhere, and I can't stay on
very well here after you are married."
</p>

<p>
"But why not?  You simply <i>must</i> stay on with
us, and manage the house as you have always done;
I couldn't bear the Manor without you."
</p>

<p>
"It is very nice of you, Reggie, to want me to go
on living here; but I am sure Fay would not like it."
</p>

<p>
I was simply aghast at this revelation of the utterly
absurd and untrue ideas which even the nicest women
get about each other.  "My dear Annabel, what utter
nonsense!  And most unjust to Fay, too!  Why,
there is nothing that Fay would like so much as for
you to live on here with her and me after we are
married: I know her well enough to answer for
that."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked doubtful.  "Are you sure, Reggie?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely certain.  Not only for the unselfish
reason that such an arrangement would be the only
really happy one for you and me, but also for the
selfish one&mdash;if anything that Fay did or thought could
by any possibility be selfish&mdash;that you would take all
the bother of managing this large household off her
hands.  Why, my dear Annabel, you yourself have
said that she is far too young to take on such a job
as this."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked thoughtful.  "That is quite true.
I'm afraid you wouldn't be very comfortable with only
Fay to look after things."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not thinking of myself," I replied, rather
huffily; "I'm really not such a selfish brute as you
make out.  I'm thinking of what a cruel thing it
would be to put such a lot of care and responsibility
on the shoulders of a child like Fay, for she is but a
child as yet, though she has all the depth and the
charm of a woman."
</p>

<p>
Annabel was still doubtful.  "She would learn."
</p>

<p>
"And why should she be bothered to learn, if you
are willing to take all the trouble off her hands?  Let
the darling be young as long as she can!  In spite
of you and Arthur, I still have scruples as to whether
it is right to let her share such a dull, middle-aged
lot as mine; but at any rate I will strive my utmost
to shield her from the cares and burdens of married
life, and to make her life as free and joyous as possible.
Therefore, Annabel, I beseech you to stay on here,
and to take all household and social duties off Fay's
shoulders."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Reggie, if you put it like that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I do put it like that, and that closes the matter.
I will go and tell Fay how good you are in consenting
to stay, as I know how relieved and happy it will
make her."
</p>

<p>
I straightway went in search of my darling, and
found her curled up with a book on one of the settees
by the hall fire.
</p>

<p>
"I have got such a glorious piece of news for you,
sweetheart," I said, sitting down beside her and
taking one of her dear hands in mine.  "Annabel has
consented to live with us after we are married, and
to take all the trouble of managing the house off your
hands.  So that my little darling will have no
housekeeping or servants to worry her, but will have
nothing to do but enjoy herself and make love to her
devoted husband."
</p>

<p>
Now one of Fay's most compelling charms was her
infinite variety: she was a creature of a thousand
moods&mdash;sometimes talkative, sometimes silent,
sometimes sad, and sometimes merry&mdash;but never the same
two hours together, and always utterly adorable.
Her changes of mood had nothing to do with outer
circumstances: they were the outcome of her own sweet
variableness and versatility.
</p>

<p>
This morning she was evidently in a silent mood,
for all she said was, "Oh!"
</p>

<p>
I expatiated upon the advantages of Annabel's
permanent support.  "You see, darling, it would
have been an awful bother for you to have to do all
the tiresome old things that Annabel does.  She is so
used to them that they are easy to her, but I couldn't
have borne to see the burden of them laid on your
dear shoulders."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say I could have learnt to do them all
right."  How like my darling not to spare herself in
her readiness to serve me.
</p>

<p>
"So Annabel said, but I would not hear of it!  Do
you think that I am marrying you, you lovely wild
elfin thing, in order to turn you into a staid
housekeeper?  It would be sacrilege to put so exquisite a
creature to such ignoble uses!"
</p>

<p>
Fay did not reply, so I continued: "And it will be
so nice for you too, dear heart, always to have a
woman at hand to turn to in any trouble or difficulty."
</p>

<p>
"I shall have you, and that is all I want."
</p>

<p>
"But I am only a stupid man, and could never
understand and help you as another woman could.
I don't believe that any man is sufficiently fine and
subtle properly to understand a woman: especially
when there is such a difference between them in age,
as there is, alas! between you and me."
</p>

<p>
"There is more difference between Annabel and me:
five years more."
</p>

<p>
"But she is a woman, and women can always understand
each other."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Because there is too much difference between
forty-two and eighteen, you are trying to make
forty-two plus forty-seven equal to eighteen.  You
always had a wonderful head for sums, Reggie!"  And
with a laugh Fay whisked herself off the settee,
and went out of the hall.
</p>

<p>
I could not understand her present mood, and the
fact that I could not understand it filled me with an
agony that after all I was too old and dull and stupid
ever to make her happy.  Then, with a blessed sense
of relief, I remembered that I should not be alone
in my sacred task of perfecting and beautifying the
young life that I had dared to take into my keeping;
Annabel would be always at hand to assist my clumsy
masculine attempts, and to correct my stupid
masculine blunders.  And I thought that between us we
could succeed in making my darling happy; at any
rate, we would try our best.
</p>

<p>
But a fresh feminine surprise awaited me.  Surely
women are the most incomprehensible creatures, and
on the time-honoured principle of "set a thief to catch
a thief," it is only a woman who can be expected to
fathom a woman.  To my amazement Ponty&mdash;whom
I expected to be lifted into the seventh heaven of
delight by the news that Annabel would stay on at
the Manor&mdash;raised strong objections to this admirable
arrangement.  I really couldn't have believed such a
thing of the faithful Ponty, if I hadn't heard her with
my own ears.
</p>

<p>
"I hear it is settled for Miss Annabel to go on living
here after your marriage, Master Reggie," she said to
me on one of my frequent visits to the old nursery&mdash;a
room which had suddenly acquired a new and wonderful
sanctity in my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I replied.  "The Manor wouldn't be
the Manor without Miss Annabel.  I could never think
of allowing her to leave it.  I should have thought
you would have been the first to rejoice at the news
that she was staying on."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'm not, Master Reggie: neither the
first nor the last nor any of the rejoicing sort at all.
When folks are married, they'd best have their home
to themselves, or else trouble'll come of it."
</p>

<p>
"No trouble possibly could come of Miss Annabel's
being anywhere.  She could never bring anything but
peace and comfort, and that you know as well as I
do."  I felt that I did well to be angry with Ponty
just then.
</p>

<p>
But she didn't mind my anger in the least: she never
had done.  "I remember a man at Poppenhall," she
went on, urging her unwise saws by means of fictitious
instances, "who married as suitable as never was,
and all went as merry as a marriage-bell till his wife's
sister came to live with them.  Then the two sisters
took to quarrelling so awful that one of them had to
go: and it was the wife as went and her sister as
stayed."
</p>

<p>
"But, my good Ponty, the cases are not parallel,"
I said, with much truth; "in your story it was the
wife's sister and not the husband's, which makes all
the difference."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter on which side the sister was:
it is the principle of having relations to live with
newly-married people that I don't approve of.
Married folks are best left to themselves till the
children come."
</p>

<p>
"But our marriage is an exceptional one," I urged.
</p>

<p>
"All marriages are exceptional to the bride and
bridegroom," replied Ponty, "just as all children are
exceptional to their own parents.  No, Master Reggie,
mark my words, when a man and a woman join hands
at the altar, they don't reckon to be starting a game
of 'Oranges and Lemons,' with their relations hanging
on to them behind and pulling them apart.  And
that's what married life comes to, if the relations on
either side live with the parties concerned."
</p>

<p>
"You are talking about things you don't in the least
understand."
</p>

<p>
But Ponty took as little notice of me as she used
to take when I was a child of six.  It was never very
wise of me to be dignified with Ponty.  "I understand
that it's a big job anyway for a husband and
wife to shake down together when first they are
married, Master Reggie, and it makes the job ten
times bigger when their relations begin helping them.
It's a thing they can only do when they are left to
their own two selves."
</p>

<p>
I still tried to be patient, though I was fully alive
to my old nurse's narrowness and ignorance.  How
little she grasped the true relationship between Fay
and Annabel!  "Your plan may be all very well
when a man and his wife are about the same age,
Ponty; there is a freemasonry in youth which unaided
must bring them a complete understanding of each
other.  But what you call the shaking down becomes
much more difficult when there is nearly a quarter of
a century between the two."
</p>

<p>
"Then the more difficult it is, Master Reggie, the
less they'll want anybody to help them.  You may
take my word for that.  And if you follow my advice
you won't allow Miss Annabel&mdash;nor Mr. Wildacre
neither, one side being as bad as the other&mdash;to help
you and Miss Fay to shake down together.  You'll
do the shaking down yourselves or else remain
unshook.  I remember there was a man in Poppenhall
who used to say as there was nobody as fermented a
quarrel like the peacemakers, and the same holds good
with relatives in the case of marriage."
</p>

<p>
I did not want to lose my temper with my old nurse,
so I went out of the room.  But I was dreadfully
disappointed in Ponty.  I thought she would have
known better.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
</h3>

<p>
Fay and I were married early in the year, which
always appears to me the proper time for marrying
and giving in marriage.  It seems so appropriate for
the new heaven and the new earth to begin at the
same time.  We went first to the Italian lakes and
then back to Switzerland, so that spring met us in
Italy, accompanied us through the Swiss mountains,
and arrived at Restham Manor about the same time
as we did.  Thus our path was literally strewn with
flowers all the way.
</p>

<p>
It would be both undignified and impossible, to
describe what a heavenly time that honeymoon was
to me.  I had never imagined that such bliss was
attainable in this work-a-day world: I thought it only
existed in fairy-tales.  And indeed my life was a
fairy-tale just then, with Fay for the leading fairy.
</p>

<p>
I think that it was a very happy time for her, too;
though I could not expect her to feel the absorbing
delight in my society that I felt in hers.  How could
she, considering how dull and stupid I was, and how
vivid and radiant was she?  But she seemed contented
with me, and delighted with the lakes and the
mountains and the wealth of flowers: and she grew
lovelier and more lovable every day.  Her intoxicating
society renewed my youth, and we walked and
rode and boated together like a pair of happy and
careless children, till I believed that she had spoken
truth when she said that Love had indeed accomplished
the impossible as far as I was concerned, and
had set the shadow on the dial ten degrees backward.
</p>

<p>
The arrangements for our honeymoon had been
highly approved of by Annabel, as they prevented
that meeting between the east wind and me, which
she spent her life in trying to avert, so that by the
time we reached home at the end of April, the east
wind was chained up again in his kennel with the
keenest of his teeth extracted.  At least so Annabel
preached, and so she believed; for my part I had
met him rushing loose about the fields on a May
morning, with a tooth as keen as any ingratitude of
man's.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at home on a lovely afternoon&mdash;one of
those blue and golden afternoons of late spring&mdash;and
found Annabel waiting in the hall to welcome us.
How good it was to see her there!  I should hardly
have felt it was a real home-coming without Annabel,
and nice as it was for me, I felt it was still nicer for
Fay to have a woman to come home to&mdash;a woman
who could comprehend and comfort and cherish her
as no man, however devoted, could possibly do, and
who could, to a certain extent, take the place of
the mother whom&mdash;to her lifelong impoverishment&mdash;she
had lost.
</p>

<p>
"Come and have some tea, my dear," said Annabel,
after we had duly embraced her and greeted the
entire household, who were likewise waiting in the
hall to receive us.
</p>

<p>
The household melted away as if we had read the
Riot Act over it, and we three drew near to the
gate-legged tea-table.
</p>

<p>
"You had better pour out, Fay," said Annabel,
"and take your place in your own house from the
beginning."
</p>

<p>
Fay was looking so tired that I answered for her.
"No, Annabel, you do it.  Fay is really too tired to
pour out for us two able-bodied beings.  She ought
not to wait upon other people, but to let other people
wait upon her."  She certainly did seem a fragile,
fairy-like little thing beside Annabel and me.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I, Fay?" asked Annabel.
</p>

<p>
"Just as Reggie likes," replied my darling, with
her lovely smile.
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart, you are too tired to lift that heavy
teapot.  Let Annabel do it for you."  The vessel in
question was part of an extremely solid tea-service
which had been presented to my father by an admiring
constituency on the auspicious occasion of his
marriage, and which resembled a flotilla of silver
Dreadnoughts.
</p>

<p>
Fay laughed.  "I think, as Reggie says, I had
better not tackle the big teapot till it gets used
to me: it might begin to buck or jib, and I'm
sure I shouldn't have strength to hold it in if it
did."
</p>

<p>
"It couldn't very well do that," said Annabel,
taking her accustomed seat at the table, while Fay sat
on the other side of me; "but it might overflow and
trickle down the spout, as it is by no means a good
pourer, and Jeavons always fills it too full."  (Jeavons
was our butler.)  "I can't think why servants always
make as much tea for three people as for half-a-dozen."
</p>

<p>
"I hate teapots that dribble down their chins,"
remarked Fay: "they are so messy."
</p>

<p>
Annabel gently corrected her.  "I said spout, my
dear, not chin.  Teapots don't have chins.  And now,
you two, tell me all your adventures since I saw you
last."  Whereupon she characteristically proceeded
to tell us all hers, and we neither of us could get a
word in edgeways.
</p>

<p>
"And the garden is looking perfectly lovely," she
concluded, after an exhaustive recital of the recent
happenings of Restham.  "I have had my own way
with the forget-me-nots this year, and they are going
to be a great success.  Even Cutler now owns that he
was wrong and I was right."  Whereby I perceived
that Cutler knew on which side of his bread the butter
lay.
</p>

<p>
"Of course they are not in their full perfection
yet," continued Annabel; "but they will be a sight
when they are.  You see, I was away when they were
planted last year, and he didn't put them in nearly
closely enough; but this year I superintended them
myself."
</p>

<p>
"Then it is sure to be all right," I said.
</p>

<p>
"It is," replied Annabel, unconscious of irony.
"If only people would always do what they are told,
what a great deal of trouble would be saved!  The
moment I saw them last year I told Cutler they
weren't nearly thick enough, but he wouldn't believe
me, and said they would spread."
</p>

<p>
"And didn't they?" I asked, loyalty to my own
sex drawing me over to Cutler's side.
</p>

<p>
"Not as much as he said they would, so last spring
was practically wasted as far as the forget-me-nots
were concerned.  But it taught him once for all that
I knew better than he."
</p>

<p>
"A spring is never wasted in which one learns wisdom,"
I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"I do love forget-me-nots," exclaimed Fay.  "Forget-me-not
beds are like adorable blue pools, and I
never see one without longing to jump into it and
bathe."
</p>

<p>
"That you must never do, my dear," replied
Annabel; "if you did, you would entirely spoil the
appearance of the beds for that season.  They would
never close up again properly, but would always look
straggling and untidy."
</p>

<p>
I caught Fay's eyes; but to our lasting credit we
were both able to postpone our laughter.  It is one of
the most delightful things in the world to be with
somebody who laughs at the same things as one laughs
at oneself: it creates a bond that nothing can ever
break: a bond devoid of all sentimentality, but none
the less powerful on that account.  In looking back
on as much of life's road as we have already travelled,
and recalling thoughts of our fellow-travellers therein,
I am not sure that the memories of the friends who
shared our jokes are not tenderer than the memories
of the friends who shared our sorrows, and they are
certainly much pleasanter.  I do not, however, pretend
that a similarity of taste in jokes is a sufficient
basis for matrimony, though a very firm foundation
for friendship; but since friendship forms a not
inconsiderable part of an ideal marriage, this sympathy in
matters humorous is an important consideration in
matrimony also.  And I am thankful to say that this
sympathy existed in full measure between myself and
Fay.
</p>

<p>
It existed also between myself and Frank, had I
given it full run; but there were certain things&mdash;such
as Annabel, for instance&mdash;over which I could not allow
myself to laugh too much with Frank.  But there was
nothing&mdash;not even Annabel&mdash;over which it would be
disloyal to laugh with Fay, since husband and wife
are one, and many and many a time did she and I
have together a merry time over the quaint humours
which help considerably to make this present world as
delightful a dwelling-place as it is.
</p>

<p>
But though Fay and I often laughed together at
my sister's ways&mdash;which were certainly very
laughter-provoking just then&mdash;our laughter was the laughter
of love, and I never lost the opportunity of pointing
out to Fay the sterling goodness which underlay
Annabel's peculiarities.  But I advisedly admitted
the peculiarities, as there is nothing which so
successfully sets one person against another as an assumption
of the latter's flawlessness.  The people whose geese
are all swans are responsible for many an epidemic of
cygnophobia.
</p>

<p>
But of course I never laughed with Annabel over
Fay's little ways; they, and everything else connected
with my darling, were then and always sacrosanct to
me.  It annoyed me even when Frank laughed at her&mdash;as
he very frequently did&mdash;which I admit was
inconsistent on my part, since if I had the right to laugh
at my sister, he had certainly the right to laugh at
his.  But though Frank's jokes at Fay's expense might
be lawful, to me they were highly inexpedient.
</p>

<p>
It was the first Sunday after our return home.  In
the morning Fay, Annabel and I attended Divine
Service in Restham Church, and "sat under" Arthur,
Annabel in her usual place at the top of the Manor
pew, and Fay close to me at the bottom, so that
during the lessons and the sermon, and such unoccupied
times, we could slip our respective hands into one
another's without any one perceiving it.  As I knelt
in the church where I had worshipped from my
childhood, and realised that to me had been given my
heart's desire, I felt as one who came home with joy,
bringing his sheaves with him, and I gave God thanks.
</p>

<p>
After the service was over we walked round the
Manor House garden accompanied by Arthur, which
was as much a part of the morning's ritual as the
Litany or the prayer for the King.  I believe Annabel
would have thought it almost wicked to omit this
sabbatic peregrination, if the weather permitted it.
Certainly I could not remember a time when we had
not walked round the garden every Sunday after
service, remarking how the vegetable kingdom had
either advanced or receded (according to the season
of the year) since the preceding Sunday.
</p>

<p>
But if my sister would have included an omission
of that Sunday morning's walk round the garden
among those things left undone which she ought to
have done, she certainly would have considered the
taking of any further exercise on a Sunday as among
the things which she ought not to have done; therefore
Fay and I started off for a long walk that Sunday
afternoon, unhampered by the encompassing presence
of Annabel.  A nap between lunch and tea was one
of the most sacred rites of Annabel's strict sabbatic
ritual.
</p>

<p>
"Now isn't it lovely to set out for a walk together
and to feel that we've got the rest of our lives to finish
it in, and that there's nothing to hurry home for?"
exclaimed Fay, as we walked across the garden.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing to hurry home for because we are
home," I replied, as we went through the little gate
which separated the lawn from the park: "wherever
you are is home to me."
</p>

<p>
"Same here," retorted Fay; "like snails, we carry
our home on our backs, which is very delightful and
picnicky when you come to think of it."
</p>

<p>
"That's where we are so superior to snails," I
pointed out; "they carry their own, while we carry
each other's: a far finer type, if you'll permit me to
say so."
</p>

<p>
"I remember once when I was a little girl, Mother
corrected me for being vain, and said it was horrid
of me to think I was pretty.  I thought it over, and
then I came back to her and explained that I didn't
think I was pretty&mdash;I only thought I was better
looking than a frog, and I asked her if it was
'vainness' to think I was better looking than a frog, and
she agreed it wasn't.  In the same way I don't think
it is a 'vainness' of us to think we are finer characters
than snails, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"By no means.  And I go farther: I don't even
think it is 'vainness' on your part to think you are
pretty."
</p>

<p>
Fay laughed.  "I'm glad it isn't, for I do."
</p>

<p>
"You darling!"
</p>

<p>
"And I'm not selfish in my 'vainness' either," she
went on, "or narrow.  I think you are very good
looking too; <i>much</i> better looking than a frog, Reggie,
<i>much</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"You silly child, what nonsense you are talking!
You'll really make me horribly vain if you go on like
this!" I said reprovingly.  But I liked it, nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
"And a jolly good thing if I did!  You aren't vain
enough; it's the one flaw in your otherwise admirable
character."
</p>

<p>
"It's much too soon for you to begin to find out
your husband's faults, Fay; you oughtn't to have
discovered one for at least six months.  You'll make a
terrible wife if you go on like this!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not finding out my husband's faults: I'm only
regretting that he doesn't possess one."
</p>

<p>
"He is all fault that hath no fault at all," I quoted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't mean that you don't possess a fault
at all, far from it; I mean you don't possess one
particular fault, namely, vanity, and that it would be a
jolly sight better for you if you did.  You don't think
half well enough of yourself, Reggie, you don't
really, and it is such a pity.  You've no idea how
perfectly good and clever and altogether splendid
you are."
</p>

<p>
"Then you ought to commend me for my humility
instead of scolding me like this," I urged in
self-defence.
</p>

<p>
Fay shook her curly head.  "Humility is a thing
which can very soon be overdone&mdash;especially in a case
like yours."
</p>

<p>
"For instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you aren't properly proud of the things
you ought to be proud of, and you've got such
lots of them," explained Fay, with some lack of
lucidity.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow I'm jolly proud of the one thing I've a
right to be proud of, and that is my wife," I
replied.
</p>

<p>
"That's you all over, wrapping other people up
in the mantle of your own virtues, and then admiring
the other people for being so awfully well dressed.
It's really you that makes us such a tremendously
attractive couple.  People like me because I'm your
wife, and yet you'll always believe they like you
because you're my husband.  It really is stupid
to put the cart before the horse in that way,
Reggie."
</p>

<p>
I put my arm through Fay's, drawing her nearer
to me.  "Then what on earth do you want me to
do, carry a pocket-mirror about with me, and keep
taking it out and admiring myself, like Narcissus, or
else thrust the sanguinary hand of my recent baronetcy
into every stranger's face?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, what an idiot you are!  Of course,
I think it is perfectly sweet of you not to have a
swelled head because you are rich and landed and a
baronet and all that, and not to have a swelled head
because it is such an extremely good-looking one, with
such regular features; I thoroughly approve of that
sort of humility, as I'm the last person in the world
to encourage swank; but what I do mean is that you
have so little confidence in yourself and your own
powers that you stand on one side and let other people
do the things that you'd do a million times better
than they can.  You are like that old Emperor who
thought he couldn't govern Europe, and so began to
wind up the clock instead."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.  "You've got hold of the wrong end of
the stick this time, milady; it was because Charles
the Fifth was sick of the weight of empire that he
retired to a monastery and made clocks: and it was
considered a most swaggery thing at the time, and
was tremendously applauded by an admiring Europe,
because he was just as good at clockmaking as he was
at ruling the world."
</p>

<p>
"What you might call a good all-round man."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  Now I am the contrary of that.  The
experience of life has taught me that I am equally
inefficient in government and in clockmaking&mdash;in
short, that I am a thoroughgoing failure, and that
therefore my truest wisdom lies in getting other and
superior people to rule my empire and make my
clocks."
</p>

<p>
I regret to record that at this point of the
conversation Lady Kingsnorth stood stock still in the
middle of the road, and protruded from between her
scarlet lips the point of a little pink tongue, and then
remarked in terse if inelegant language: "You silly
ass!"
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "Your ladyship ought to be ashamed
of yourself," I said.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, my ladyship is ashamed of you!
I wouldn't be as great a goose as you are, Reggie, for
ten thousand a year."
</p>

<p>
"It is about what I get for it," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause whilst I opened a gate for our
passing, and shut it again, and then I said: "By the
way, my own, it is your birthday this week.  What
shall I get you for a present?"
</p>

<p>
Fay tripped beside me on the grass.  She was very
like a child in her movements.  "I've had such lovely
wedding presents from you that I really don't seem
to have room for any more."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you must make room somehow.  It would
be against all my principles to let so great an occasion
as your birthday pass unwept, unhonoured and unsung."
</p>

<p>
"I really couldn't make room for any more jewellery.
I'm plastered over with it already, like a rough-cast
house."  I had had all my mother's diamonds reset
for Fay, and had given her a string of pearls on my
own account.
</p>

<p>
"Well then, a set of furs ready for the winter,"
I suggested.  "It is a good time now for buying furs."
</p>

<p>
Fay shook her head.  "Too expensive after all
those lovely wedding presents."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense, my darling!  Nothing is too
expensive for you."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I really do want," said Fay,
taking my arm and dancing beside me like a little
girl: "I want a nice, small Prayer Book to use every
Sunday in church.  And I should like it bound in
green, my favourite colour."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever do you want another Prayer Book for,
sweetheart?" I asked, surprised at this strange
request.  "Our pew is simply paved and panelled with
them."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't like huge things with crests and
coats-of-arms on the outside: I can't pray properly out of
them.  It's like sending one's prayers to heaven in
a Lord Mayor's coach instead of on angels' wings.
I want a little green Prayer Book of my very own,
with a 'Hymns Ancient and Modern' at the end of
it: one of those semi-detached sort of affairs, don't
you know!&mdash;in the same case, but with separate
entrances.  And I want you to give it me and write
my name in it, so that my love for you and my
prayers and praises will all be bound up together."
</p>

<p>
"But it seems such a poor present for me to give
you, darling," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"But it's what I want.  Those crested and coat-of-armed
Prayer Books in the pew are several sizes
too large and too grand for me.  And they are so
public and general, too: nothing private and personal
about them.  I don't care for a Prayer Book with
the family coat-of-arms on it.  And, besides, I don't
think coats-of-arms and Prayer Books are in the same
dimension, somehow."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, sweetheart?"  Fay's ideas&mdash;ideas
which Annabel would have dismissed as
"funny"&mdash;were always of absorbing interest to me.
</p>

<p>
"Crests and coats-of-arms belong to the temporal
things, such as carriages and motors and notepaper
and silver-plate, and so are suitable ornaments for all
these objects; but names and Prayer Books belong to
the eternal things, and so are on a different plane
altogether.  When a baby is baptised a Christian it
isn't given a new crest, but a new name: it isn't
crested, so to speak, it is christened.  And I always
love that text in the Bible about him that overcometh
being given a white stone with a new name written
on it; but you couldn't imagine God giving anybody
a white stone with a new crest engraved on it!  It
would sound absurd.  And that is because your name
is part of yourself and means <i>you</i>; while a crest is
only the sign of your family and signifies your social
position and your rank, and all those material, worthless
sort of things which the world thinks so much of,
but which God really couldn't be bothered with."
</p>

<p>
Fay stopped for breath, she was chattering so fast,
and skipping at the same time.  She was so full of
life and spirits that she never could walk soberly along
like other people.  And then she began talking again,
and so did I, and we continued the enchanting <i>solitude
à deux</i>, which is the especial prerogative of marriage,
until it was time to return home to tea and Annabel.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, when Fay was out of the room,
Annabel said to me: "Reggie, I want to ask your
advice?"
</p>

<p>
"Such as it is it is always at your service," I
replied; "though I admit I cannot just now recall any
occasion when you have availed yourself of it, your
own, as a rule, proving adequate for your needs."
</p>

<p>
"I want to know what to give Fay for a birthday
present," continued my sister.  "Just after a
wedding and all the presents, it is so difficult to find
anything that anybody wants, and it seems a waste of
money to buy what is useless."
</p>

<p>
A brilliant idea occurred to me, one which I thought
would prove of assistance in my lifework of bringing
Fay and Annabel nearer together.  Annabel should
give Fay the Prayer Book, and so become identified
with what Fay called her prayers and praises, and
therefore draw nearer to my darling's inmost heart.
It was the dream of my life that Annabel should be
as dear to Fay as she was to me, and what better way
of securing this than by associating her with Fay's
moments of religious emotion?  It appeared to me a
capital plan.
</p>

<p>
"I know what you can give her," I replied, "a
combined Prayer Book and Hymn Book beautifully
bound: it happens to be just what she wants."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked scornful.  "What a ridiculous
suggestion!  How can she want a Prayer Book when
our pew is positively packed with them?  They fit
so tight in the book-ledge that there isn't room
for even a pair of gloves or a pocket-handkerchief
between."
</p>

<p>
"She finds them too big: she wants a smaller one
of her own."  I knew my Annabel, and therefore did
not enter into any vain attempt to explain to her Fay's
actual feelings on the subject.
</p>

<p>
"I can understand her wanting a small one if she
had to carry it to church and back.  But, as she
hasn't, I should have thought the larger the better
because of the big print.  Though of course at Fay's
age the size of the print doesn't matter as it does to
you and me."  Annabel never tried to cover over the
discrepancy in age between my wife and me: not from
any disagreeableness; it was not in Annabel to be
intentionally disagreeable; but the discrepancy was
a fact, and it was not her custom to blink facts.
</p>

<p>
"The size of the print makes no difference to me,"
I replied, somewhat nettled.  "I can see small print
as well as large."
</p>

<p>
"That is because you are so short-sighted.  Short-sighted
people always keep their sight till they are
quite old.  But if you were normal you'd have to
begin spectacles at your age.  I did&mdash;at least, for fine
sewing and small print."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've told you what Fay wants, and you can
get it or not, as you like," I said, collecting my letters
and preparing to leave the room.  "If you decide on
it; I'll select it for you in town, where I am going
to-morrow; and if you decide on something else, I'll get
Fay the Prayer Book myself."
</p>

<p>
After further cogitation and argument, Annabel
finally agreed to accept my suggestion; so on the
following day I went up to London and selected a
really exquisite little "semi-detached" Prayer Book
and Hymn Book, bound in the loveliest grass-green
calf and richly tooled with gold, for Annabel to give
to Fay; and for my own present to my darling I
bought the finest set of sables I could find, which even
"at summer prices" ran well into three figures.  And
my heart leaped with joy to think how beautiful she
would look in them and how pleased she would be,
for my child-wife dearly loved a bit of finery.
</p>

<p>
And&mdash;remembering what Fay had said&mdash;I specially
instructed Annabel to write my darling's name in the
little green Prayer Book before giving it to her.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of Fay's birthday I was as excited
as a child.  I could not help knowing that both the
furs and the Prayer Book were things of beauty, and
I rejoiced at the thought of my darling's pleasure in
them.  I think there are few things more delightful
than the giving of a really handsome present to a
person who is able to appreciate it.  I had tried my
utmost to procure for Fay things which I knew were
perfect of their kind, and I flattered myself that I
had succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Fay was radiant when she awoke on her birthday
morning, and I hurried over my toilet so as to be
downstairs first in order to put her presents by her
place at the breakfast-table.
</p>

<p>
"They really are lovely furs, Reggie," said Annabel,
as I laid them out.  "I never saw sables of such a
beautiful colour.  And after all is said and done, there
is no fur that looks as handsome as sable."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you like them," I replied; "I really think
they are rather nice."
</p>

<p>
"But I wish you hadn't induced me to buy that
absurd Prayer Book.  It seems a most unsuitable
present for a bright young creature like Fay."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that'll be all right," said I, smiling in my
superior knowledge of my darling's wishes.
</p>

<p>
Then Fay came into the room, and her face lit up
at the sight of her presents.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how lovely!" she exclaimed, rushing
to the breakfast-table to examine them more closely.
First she picked up the Prayer Book, and at
once turned to the fly-leaf where her dear name was
written.  Then a puzzled expression clouded her face.
"Frances Kingsnorth, from her affectionate sister-in-law
Annabel," she read aloud.  "I don't quite understand,"
she added, looking to me for explanation.  "I
thought you were going to give me the Prayer Book."
</p>

<p>
"So I was, darling," I replied; "but then it
occurred to me what a good thing it would be for
Annabel to give you that, and for me to give you the
set of furs I had originally intended.  Annabel was
so anxious to give you something that you really
wanted, and I knew you wanted that."
</p>

<p>
"It is lovely," said Fay, turning over the leaves
with her slim fingers, and glancing at the illuminations
inside the book.  "Thank you so much, dear
Annabel."  And she came round to Annabel's place
and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you like it, my dear," said Annabel.
"I wanted to get you something to wear&mdash;something
more suitable for a young girl than a Prayer Book,
but Reggie insisted."
</p>

<p>
"It was so dear of you to want to get me exactly
what you thought I wanted," Fay replied; "and I
think it is the most exquisite Prayer Book that I've
ever seen" (which I really believe it was).
</p>

<p>
"And now you must look at my present, sweetheart,"
I said, spreading out the furs.
</p>

<p>
"They are beautiful; much too handsome for me."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is too handsome for you, Fay: cloth-of-gold
wouldn't be, if I could get it.  Won't you try
them on?"
</p>

<p>
"Not now, I think.  Thank you very much for
them, Reggie, but it really is too hot a morning for
trying on furs."
</p>

<p>
"So it is, my dear," Annabel chimed in.  "I
wonder at Reggie's being so stupid as to suggest it;
and before you've had your breakfast, too," she
added, as if breakfast were a cooling ceremony.
</p>

<p>
And then we all sat down to breakfast.  Fay was
absolutely different from what she had been upstairs;
but that was just her way; she was as changeable and
charming as an April day, and with as little reason
for it.
</p>

<p>
Two or three weeks after this, Annabel said to me:
"You were wrong after all about that absurd Prayer
Book, Reggie.  I know it was a ridiculous present for
a young girl.  I'd much better have given Fay a new
sunshade, or something pretty to wear."
</p>

<p>
"It was what she said she wanted," I urged in self-defence.
</p>

<p>
"You must have misunderstood her.  You are
rather stupid, you know, at misunderstanding people:
it comes from being so dreamy and thinking of other
things.  And she couldn't really have wanted it, for
I notice that she never takes it to Church."
</p>

<p>
I had noticed this also, but had carefully refrained
from remarking upon it.  I endeavoured never to
remark upon Fay's doings for fear she should imagine
I wanted to control them: my one desire was that she
should feel as free as air.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't really matter," continued Annabel;
"but the next time I shall select Fay's birthday
present myself.  I never thought you'd understand a
young girl's thoughts and wishes, and I don't see how
it is to be expected that you should, at your age and
with no experience of them.  But in future I shall use
my own judgment."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Annabel, intent upon her household
duties, left me with the crushing conviction that I was
a failure as a husband, as I had been in everything
else.
</p>

<p>
Even with Fay&mdash;who was dearer to me than life
itself&mdash;I seemed to do the wrong thing.
</p>

<p>
And yet this time I could not see where I had
blundered.  She certainly said that she wanted a green
Prayer Book with her name written in it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
IN JUNE
</h3>

<p>
Frank came home from Oxford early in
June&mdash;nominally to read with Blathwayte during the Long;
and then we had indeed a merry time at Restham,
the maddest, merriest time I ever had in my life,
before or since.  In fact, the whole of the summer
was as a midsummer night's dream to me.  I suggested
that although Frank had to work at the Rectory
for such part of the day as he deigned to waste upon
study, there was no reason why he should not render
his home at the Manor.  I thought that, this arrangement
would make the house more cheerful for Fay;
for&mdash;though she was far too sweet and unselfish ever
to betray such a feeling&mdash;I could not help being
conscious that the society of two such middle-aged fogies
as Annabel and myself was but poor company for a
girl of nineteen.  Of course Fay was delighted at
this suggestion of mine, and Annabel not much less
so.  If my sister had a soft place in her heart, except
the one reserved for me, that place was most certainly
occupied by Frank Wildacre.
</p>

<p>
To my surprise the only person who did not approve
of this arrangement was Ponty.
</p>

<p>
"So I hear Mr. Wildacre is coming to live here
now," she said to me one morning, in her most
ungracious manner; "the Manor will soon be as full of
couples as Noah's Ark."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you were fond of Mr. Wildacre," I
feebly urged.
</p>

<p>
"So I am, Sir Reginald&mdash;in his proper place: just
as I am of Miss Annabel.  But things out of their own
place are worse than useless, as the woman said when
she found the cat in the tea-kettle."  Ponty never
addressed me as "Sir Reginald" unless I was in dire
disgrace with her.
</p>

<p>
"And he will be such nice company for her ladyship,"
I went on, ashamed of my own cowardice, yet
persisting in it.  My passion for peace at any price
has always been one of my most unworthy characteristics.
I envy those people who can annoy their fellows
without turning a hair.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Sir Reginald, you are master in your
own house&mdash;at least, you ought to be," said Ponty
darkly; "and if you are set on spending your married
life in playing 'Oranges and Lemons,' nobody can
stop you.  Everybody's got the right to spoil their
own lives in their own way, more's the pity!  I
remember a married couple at Poppenhall who would
have the wife's brother to live with them, and he fell
into the fire and was burnt to death, through having
epileptic fits."
</p>

<p>
"But he'd have fallen into the fire just the same
if he hadn't lived with them," I argued, with a
culpable lack of dignity; "and then they would always
have blamed themselves for having neglected him."
</p>

<p>
"That is as may be, Sir Reginald: he might or he
might not.  But as it was, they did blame themselves,
I can tell you, and the husband took to drink in
consequence, he blamed himself so much."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't think he need have gone to such
lengths as that by way of expiating his mistake," I
said cheerfully.  "And besides, that has no bearing
upon the present case, as Mr. Wildacre doesn't suffer
from fits."
</p>

<p>
Ponty sighed the heavy sigh of disapproval.  "There
are other things besides fits, Sir Reginald."
</p>

<p>
I remarked that fortunately there were, and then
left the nursery.  I should have been irritated with
Ponty, but her unbounded admiration of Fay made
me freely forgive her anything and everything.  Still
I wondered at her attitude, though I was fast learning
not to be surprised at any vagary of the feminine
mind, but just to accept it as one of the unfathomable
mysteries.
</p>

<p>
Frank's presence at the Manor made a wonderful
difference to Fay.  He stimulated what I called the
elfin side of her nature, and brought out those
qualities which she possessed in common with him.  I have
frequently noticed that when members of the same
family are together, all the family traits rise to the
surface, while individual characteristics fall into
abeyance for the time being.  The unit is, so to speak,
merged in the tribe.
</p>

<p>
I remarked upon this one day at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"I know what you mean," said Frank.  (The Wildacres
were always very quick to catch an idea.)  "The
Joneses become all Jones, and the Smiths become all
Smith at their Christmas family dinner, and the
separate Johns and Roberts and Marias, with their
individual characteristics, are swallowed up in the
great Nirvana of Jonesism and Smithism."
</p>

<p>
"And Jonesism and Smithism are consequently
tremendously intensified," Fay chimed in; "it is only
at such family gatherings that one realises the hugeness
of the Jones nose, or the bitterness of the Smith
temper.  I expect when all the Hapsburgs are
together the size of their historical under lip becomes
something stupendous."
</p>

<p>
"I do not quite see how a Christmas party can
lengthen anybody's nose or swell their under lip,"
remarked Annabel, full of patient endeavour to
discover a grain of sense in all the chaff of our
nonsense.
</p>

<p>
"Unless it ended in a fight," suggested Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course, in that case it might; but I thought
you were talking of friendly family gatherings."
</p>

<p>
"So we were, Annabel," I explained; "Fay and
Frank were only speaking figuratively."  I was always
so dreadfully afraid that my sister would consider Fay
foolish.
</p>

<p>
Fay went on with the conversation.  It was a
matter of absolute indifference to her whether Annabel
considered her foolish or not, and this grieved me, as
I was so anxious for Annabel to do my darling justice,
and I could see that Fay herself sometimes rendered
this difficult.  "But when members of a family
marry," she said, "and go to houses of their own,
their respective personalities develop, and what Frank
calls the Jones-and-Smith Nirvana is broken up.  Then
we see that what we imagined to be a complete tea-set
was really a collection of separate pieces of
different kinds of china."
</p>

<p>
"But throw them together at their Christmas
party," added Frank, "and they will at once grow
into each other's likeness, and your tribal tea-set will
be complete once more."
</p>

<p>
"You children talk so fast that I really cannot
follow you," said Annabel good-naturedly from behind
the coffee-urn.  "I don't see how noses and under lips
can turn into tea-sets."
</p>

<p>
"They can't," I agreed.  "All we were saying is that
when members of the same family are together, they
bring out the family characteristics in each other."
</p>

<p>
But Annabel was not grateful for my efforts on her
behalf.  "You said that some time ago, Reggie; of
course I understood that, though I don't altogether
agree with it.  But it is the things that the children
have said since that slightly confused me."
</p>

<p>
I wished Annabel would not always speak of Frank
and Fay as "the children."  It seemed so to emphasise
the gulf between Fay and myself.  But Annabel
had got into the habit of thus speaking of them before
my marriage; and Annabel and a habit, when once
formed, were inseparable.
</p>

<p>
"I know why you said it, Reggie," said Fay, who
could always read me like a book.  I often wished
that I could as easily read her!  "You were thinking
that when Frank is here I am much more of a
Wildacre than when he isn't: just as when you are with
Annabel you are much more of a Kingsnorth than
when you are alone with me."
</p>

<p>
That was exactly what I had been thinking&mdash;at
least, the former part of it; I did not at all agree
with Fay that I was more of a Kingsnorth when I was
with Annabel, but it was rather a shock to hear it thus
crudely put into words.  That is what strikes me
about the young people of to-day: they are so much
more outspoken than we were at their age.  Our
parents veiled Truth&mdash;we clothed her&mdash;but the present
generation treats her as the Earl of Mercia treated
Godiva.  And this treatment is slightly upsetting to
us who were brought up so differently.
</p>

<p>
Annabel answered for me.  "That is only natural,
my dear, considering that Frank and you are the same
age, and Reggie and I are so much older.  It is nice
for the young to be with the young, it keeps them
bright and cheerful, and it is depressing for them to
be constantly with persons old enough to be their
parents."
</p>

<p>
Fay's grey eyes flashed.  "I never find it depressing
to be with Reggie," she retorted, somewhat hotly.
"He always bucks me up."
</p>

<p>
But Annabel's temper remained impregnable.  It
was only Cutler who had the power to shake that
fortress.  "I never said you did, my dear.  You are
far too loyal a little wife ever to think of such a thing.
But it is natural for youth to cling to youth; it would
be abnormal of it if it didn't."
</p>

<p>
Fay still looked angry.  "I don't care a twopenny
dam if I am abnormal or not.  I never want to cling
to anybody but Reggie."
</p>

<p>
I felt it was time to step in.  I didn't want Fay to
say anything to offend Annabel.  "Of course you
don't, darling, and I am only too delighted to be clung
to to any extent; it is most warming and comforting
to me.  But I fear Annabel is right in regarding me
as the old oak tree to which the ivy clings."
</p>

<p>
Fay slipped her hand into mine, under cover of the
breakfast-table.  "You aren't a bit old, Reggie!" she
said indignantly.  "Is he, Frank?"
</p>

<p>
"I've known older," replied Frank guardedly.
</p>

<p>
At this we all laughed&mdash;especially Annabel.  Frank's
jokes usually appealed to her, though Fay's didn't,
which was strange, as the twins resembled each other
mentally almost as much as they did physically: it
was only in the deeper places of the spirit that the
resemblance ended.
</p>

<p>
"Reggie is not old and he is not young," said
Annabel; "I never can understand why people make such
a fuss about their ages.  I am forty-eight and Reggie
is forty-three this year, and I make no bones about it,
and it would be no good if I did, as it's in <i>Burke</i>
and <i>Debrett</i> for all the world to read.  And I really
don't think, my dear Fay, that 'a twopenny dam' is
at all a nice expression for a young lady to use: I
cannot bear to hear women swear."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't swearing, Miss Kingsnorth," cried Frank,
who was always ready to stick up for his sister; "it's
a foreign coin which was much used by the great Duke
of Wellington."
</p>

<p>
"So I've heard," replied Annabel, with doubt in her
tone.  "But all I can say is that if it isn't swearing, it
sounds uncommonly like it, and I'm sure that any
ordinary person hearing it would do Fay an injustice,
and imagine that she was given to bad language."
</p>

<p>
I felt it was time to read the Riot Act and disperse
the company; so I rose from the table and took my
pipe out of my pocket, saying: "Come on, little girl,
and watch me smoking in the garden.  It will be a
soothing, soporific sight."
</p>

<p>
Fay jumped up and followed me, as I knew she
would.  One of her most fascinating tricks was a
habit she had of trotting about the house and garden
after me like a little child.  And yet in some things
she was so much of a woman!
</p>

<p>
"I say, sweetheart," I said as soon as we were
out of earshot of the house, "I wouldn't use strong
language before Annabel, if I were you.  She doesn't
understand it, and it gives her false ideas of you."
</p>

<p>
Fay's scarlet lips pouted.  "It wasn't strong
language.  Frank told you it wasn't."
</p>

<p>
It always annoyed me when Fay quoted Frank, and
especially when she did so in order to confute me.  "I
know, my darling; but Annabel thought it was."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help Annabel's thoughts.  She thought you
were old!"
</p>

<p>
I laughed, and patted the soft, white cheek so near
to my own as we sat down side by side on a
garden-seat.  "No, she didn't, little one."
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway she said so."
</p>

<p>
"No, she didn't.  She said I was forty-three&mdash;which
I am, and forty-three seems quite young to
Annabel, though old to you."
</p>

<p>
Fay still looked angry.  "Indeed it doesn't.  It
seems quite young to me.  And whatever it seems, I
don't see the good of harping on it and rubbing it in,
as Annabel is always doing.  If she says 'forty-three'
again, I shall say 'twopenny dam.'"
</p>

<p>
I laughed outright.  Fay was so delicious when she
was annoyed, like a brilliant little bird with ruffled
plumage.  Then I said softly, as I put my arms round
her slender waist: "No you won't, sweetheart, you'll
never say it again, if it vexes Annabel.  I want you
and Annabel to love each other more than I want
anything in the world."
</p>

<p>
"More than you want you and me to love each other?"
</p>

<p>
"That wish has been already fulfilled&mdash;by the greatest
miracle that ever happened."
</p>

<p>
Fay nestled closer to me.  "It isn't very polite of
you to say that your loving me is anything in the
miracle line."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't.  It is in your loving me that the miracle
comes in.  I didn't set the dial ten degrees forward:
you set it ten degrees backward."
</p>

<p>
My wife looked up at me with laughter in her
wonderful eyes.  "And you want me to do the trick
again with Annabel?  Really, Reggie, that is a little
bit too thick!  And besides, she wouldn't like it.  The
dial of Annabel is quite a different make from the dial
of Ahaz.  It is one of those that can't be put back even
five minutes without upsetting all the machinery and
making the strikes go wrong, like our dining-room
clock.  And I wouldn't upset Annabel's machinery for
worlds!  I should feel like Cutler if I did."
</p>

<p>
"And even Cutler didn't upset it this year, if I
remember rightly."
</p>

<p>
Fay shook her head.  "No, the forget-me-not bed
this last spring was the last word in forget-me-not
beds.  It was a thing of beauty and a joy for the end
of April and quite the whole of May.  I wanted to
bathe in it, if you remember, but Annabel thought I
might get drowned or something, and so I refrained."
</p>

<p>
"Annabel has her funny little ways, I admit," I
said, feeling that this was the moment for a word in
season on my sister's behalf; "but she is the best and
kindest woman in the world, and she is really devoted
to you, my darling, though she doesn't always
understand you."
</p>

<p>
"She does not like me anything like as much as she
likes Frank."
</p>

<p>
"She really does&mdash;underneath her quiet manner;
but she has always been a most undemonstrative
woman," I persisted, feeling bound to defend my
sister against an accusation of such arrant folly.
</p>

<p>
Fay smiled.  "What a darling old ostrich it is!"
she said, stroking my hand.  "Does it like to keep its
dear head in the sand, and go on pretending to itself
that rocks are palm-trees and dry streams wells of
water?  Then it shall, if it likes.  But all the same,
my Reggie, it's rather stupid of you always to pretend
that things are what you want them to be; because
they aren't, and you'll have a tremendous waking up
some fine morning."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not pretending," I said stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are.  You are always pretending to
yourself that Annabel is devoted to me, and she really
isn't one little bit.  Frank says she isn't, and if he
can see it I'm sure you ought to, Reggie.  There is no
harm in her not admiring me: it would be very strange
if she did, considering how much older she is and
how different we are; and she really is awfully nice
to me, considering everything.  Frank admits that.
But when you go on pretending that she spends her
life in sighing like a furnace for me, and writing
odes to my eyebrows&mdash;why, then, I get so impatient
of it all that I find it difficult to see how nice she
really is."
</p>

<p>
"All that would be quite right, sweetheart, if I
really were pretending.  But I'm not.  I know Annabel
a jolly sight better than you do, and I know she is
absolutely devoted to you."
</p>

<p>
And at that I left it and made love to my wife
instead, a much more agreeable occupation, in spite of
that jealousy of Frank seething at the back of my
mind.
</p>

<p>
As I had said to Fay, I was absolutely convinced of
Annabel's devotion to her.  And what wonder in that?
Who could live with my child-wife, as Annabel and
I lived with her, and see all her charms of person
and beauties of character without loving her with all
one's heart?  She was made for love, my brilliant,
beautiful darling, and she had it showered upon her
in full measure.  But I was not equally sure of Fay's
affection for Annabel.  I knew all my sister's
virtues&mdash;none better; but I could see they were not exactly
the brand of virtues most calculated to appeal to the
young.  Annabel was prim and fussy and masterful;
there was no denying it, and these characteristics&mdash;one
could hardly call them faults&mdash;were just the qualities
to blind the eyes of a girl to any corresponding
virtues.  Therefore I felt it was for me, who really
knew and understood my sister, to show both her
superior points and screen her inferior ones when they
were alike exposed to the piercing gaze of youthful
eyes.  Though Fay's youthful eyes were kind enough,
Frank's were quite the reverse, and I was becoming
increasingly afraid of the influence of Frank's
clear-sighted callousness upon my wife.  To him I was&mdash;I
must inevitably be&mdash;an old fogey; but I did not like
the idea of his sharing that impression of my fogeydom
with Fay.
</p>

<p>
As Fay and I were sitting hand-in-hand upon the
garden-seat that blissful June morning, a shadow fell
upon the grass, and we saw Jeavons approaching us
with a message from the house.
</p>

<p>
"If you please, Sir Reginald," he began, coming as
close to us before he spoke as if we had been deaf,
after the manner of well-trained servants, "Mrs. Parkins
out of the village has called to ask if you will
kindly go and see her father-in-law, him being in
terrible pain this morning with his sciatica, and asking
for you all the time."
</p>

<p>
Jeavons never used such words as "pray" or "heal"
when he brought me messages from the village people
begging for my ministrations.  He reserved such
expressions for what he considered their proper
place&mdash;namely, the church and the doctor's surgery
respectively.  Though they knew their own places&mdash;and
kept to them&mdash;Jeavons and Annabel had much in
common: the same absolute devotion to the conventional
and the commonplace&mdash;the same horror of the
emotional and the unusual.
</p>

<p>
I rose from my seat.  "Tell Mrs. Parkins that I
will come at once," I said.  "Fay, will you come
with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will," she replied, and we crossed the
lawn and went through the heavy garden-door, hatless
as we were, into the village, and past the old inn
to Parkins's cottage.
</p>

<p>
I often took my wife with me when I went to visit
the sick, because I believed that "two or three gathered
together" literally meant two or three gathered
together, and that therefore, when Fay's supplications
were added to mine, my prayer was all the more
efficacious.
</p>

<p>
I have found life so much simpler and easier since
I learned to take the Bible literally, and not to be
always reading between the lines to find out spiritual
meanings which might or might not be there.  I
remember an enlightened and eminent modern Dean
once explaining to me that when Christ said, "The
blind see, the deaf hear, the lame walk and the lepers
are cleansed," He meant that those hitherto blind to
spiritual visions were enlightened, those hitherto deaf
to sacred truths were made to hear them, those who
had aforetime stumbled were able to walk in the paths
of righteousness, and those steeped in sin were washed
clean.  "Mr. Dean," I replied, "you, as a dignitary
of the Church, probably know better than I what
Christ <i>meant</i>; a mere layman such as myself can only
deal with what He <i>said</i>: and He didn't say anything
at all like that."
</p>

<p>
I hate "reading between the lines," even in ordinary
human correspondence.  At least a third of the troubles
of this life have their origin in their pernicious habit;
for people read a great deal of unintentional enmity&mdash;and,
still worse, a great deal of imaginary love&mdash;into
pages actually virgin of either of these extremes.
And when they read between the lines of Holy Scripture,
they read in all their own prejudices and fads
and fancies, until Divine Truth is distorted and perverted.
</p>

<p>
I can stand many things, but I cannot stand a
Bowdlerised Bible.
</p>

<p>
Fay and I entered the cottage, whither Mrs. Parkins
had preceded us.
</p>

<p>
"It be good of you to come, Sir Reginald, and her
ladyship too, but the poor old man be sufferin'
something fearful, and all twisted up with the pain in his
back and his legs.  But he says if only you'll lay your
hands on him and say a prayer like as you did before,
the pain'll be bound to go."
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll go up to him at once," I said; and
Mrs. Parkins straightway preceded us up one of those
steep and dark and narrow cottage-staircases which
never fail to arouse in me an undying wonder that
the poor ever keep their necks intact.  I feel sure that
guardian angels are as thick on cottage-staircases as
they ever were on Jacob's ladder.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. Parkins," said Fay as she entered
the pretty and spotlessly clean bedchamber of
old Parkins; "we are very sorry the pain is so bad
this morning, but Sir Reginald has come to cure it."
</p>

<p>
"Parkins knows better than that," I said as I bent
my head to pass through the low doorway, "don't
you, Parkins?  You know as well as I do that it isn't
I who cure the pain, but our Lord working through me."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, Sir Reginald, I knows that well enough,
becos you've told me; and you ought to know for sure
and certain.  But I'd be glad if somebody 'ud help
me quick, for the pain's powerful bad this mornin',"
and the poor old soul fairly groaned in his agony.
</p>

<p>
Without more ado I knelt beside the bed and laid
my hands on the poor, twisted limbs: and as I prayed
I was conscious of the Power descending on me, and
passing through me to the old man in the bed.  Gradually
the groans ceased, and the look of anguish passed
from the wrinkled face as if it had been wiped off by
a sponge, and Parkins fell into the peaceful sleep of a
tired child.
</p>

<p>
As I rose from my knees and stood by the sleeping
sufferer whom I had been permitted to relieve, a great
longing filled my heart for the time when there will no
longer be any need for surgeons or physicians or
spiritual healers, or for any other channels whereby
the Healing Power of Christ is conveyed to sick and
suffering humanity&mdash;to the time when the knowledge
of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover
the sea, and when there shall be no more sickness nor
sorrow nor sighing, neither shall there be any more
pain, because Christ will be all in all.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
SHAKSPERE AND THE MUSICAL GLASSES
</h3>

<p>
One day as we were having luncheon&mdash;Blathwayte
being one of the party&mdash;Annabel remarked: "I am
terribly worried with one thing or another."
</p>

<p>
Arthur and I hastened to express our sympathy, and
to inquire the cause of her disquietude.
</p>

<p>
"For one thing, I can't think how to raise a little
money for the Parish Nurse Fund this year: we always
have an entertainment of some kind every three or
four years, you know, to eke out the subscriptions
which aren't enough by themselves, and I really don't
like the way this new cook fricassees: her gravy is so
much too watery.  Yet in other things&mdash;especially
frying&mdash;she suits me so well; and changing servants,
especially cooks, is always so very worrying.  I can't
think what induced Mrs. Wilkinson to get married."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilkinson was our ex-cook-housekeeper, who
had so far forgotten herself&mdash;and Annabel&mdash;as to
enter the holy estate of matrimony shortly after I
myself took that momentous plunge.
</p>

<p>
"I expect the same as induces most people," said
Arthur: "she wanted to."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it was very inconsiderate and selfish after
all my kindness and consideration for her," said
Annabel severely; "only two years ago I kept the
situation open for two months while she had something the
matter with her leg&mdash;I forget what it was, but I
think it began with an 'E'&mdash;or was it an 'I'?&mdash;and I
put up with the kitchenmaid and scullerymaid and
outside help for all that time, giving Mrs. Wilkinson her
full wages.  And after that, I think it was too bad
of her to throw me over in this way."
</p>

<p>
"And for the sake of a mere man," I added.
</p>

<p>
"No worse for a mere man than for a mere woman;
the wrong thing was throwing me over at all, after all
my kindness to her, and waiting for her for two
months.  Of course, if I'd known she was going to
be married, I should have let her leg take her away
permanently.  But I can't imagine what put such an
idea into her head."
</p>

<p>
"Probably the man she married," said Fay; "men
have a way of putting such ideas into our heads at
times."
</p>

<p>
"And at her age, too," continued the aggrieved
one; "she owns to forty-five, and if people own to
forty-five they'll own to anything.  And as to the new
cook's gravies, they really are not what we have been
accustomed to at the Manor; so thin and tasteless;
and I very much doubt if she is strict enough with
Cutler about bringing in sufficient vegetables.  Cutler
requires a firm hand."
</p>

<p>
"And he gets it, Miss Kingsnorth," cried Frank:
"so firm that I've seen him stagger under it at
times."
</p>

<p>
Fay giggled.  In fact, during the whole conversation
she and Frank had kept catching each other's eye,
and indulging in suppressed mirth.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know if you have noticed it, Mr. Blathwayte,"
Annabel went on, "but gardeners are so
dreadfully obstinate about bringing in sufficient
vegetables.  Cutler is really terrible about the peas.  He
seems to think they are planted to be looked at instead
of eaten.  And that is where Mrs. Wilkinson was so
satisfactory: she mastered him completely, and made
him bring in whatever vegetables she required."
</p>

<p>
"That augurs well for her chances of conjugal
felicity, and less well for those of her husband," I
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"It was so silly of her to want a husband at her
time of life," continued Annabel; "besides being so
unfair to me.  And what we are to do this year to
eke out the Parish Nurse money I cannot imagine.
I had a Sale of Work two years ago, and a Concert
two years before that, and I don't want to have either
of them again so soon, though I don't see what else I
can have, and we haven't money enough without."
</p>

<p>
"It is such a business getting up a Sale of Work in
a small parish like this," said Arthur.
</p>

<p>
Annabel agreed with him.  "And in a little village
people don't want a lot of tea-cosies and antimacassars
and fancy blotters," she added, as if in large towns the
thirst for these articles was insatiable.
</p>

<p>
"Why not have a Jumble Sale?" suggested Fay.
"Jumble sales are so splendid at killing three birds
with one stone: they clothe the naked, feed the hungry,
and clear out your wardrobe at the same time."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how they feed the hungry," Arthur
objected.
</p>

<p>
But Fay had her answer ready.  "By the money
they make, of course.  And in the present instance
feeding the hungry would be a synonym for supporting
the Parish Nurse."
</p>

<p>
Annabel's brow was lined with anxiety.  "I see
what you mean about Jumble sales, but they have
terrible disadvantages."
</p>

<p>
"As for instance?" I prompted her.  I saw she was
bursting to divulge the tragedies attendant upon
Jumble sales.
</p>

<p>
"We had one, if you remember, five or six years ago
for the village hall, and made quite a nice little sum
by it.  But Cutler bought one of Reggie's old suits
at it, and wore it on a Sunday afternoon when he came
up to see after the stove in the greenhouses; and I saw
him standing in the peach-house and went up to him
and put my hand on his shoulder, thinking he was
Reggie!  Wasn't it dreadful?  I feel I shall never get
over it as long as I live."
</p>

<p>
Of course the twins shouted with laughter at this,
and Arthur and I were not far behind them in our
exuberance of mirth.  But Annabel looked quite
serious&mdash;even distressed.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing to laugh at in it&mdash;nothing at all,"
she said in accents of reproof; "it was a most
embarrassing position both for me and for Cutler.  I'm
sure I pitied him as much as I pitied myself."
</p>

<p>
"Did you say anything?" I asked as soon as I
could speak&mdash;"while you still believed him to be me,
I mean?"
</p>

<p>
Annabel blushed: five long years had not obliterated
the disgrace of that terrible moment in the peach-house.
"Unfortunately I did; I said: 'What are you
doing here, my dear?'  It wouldn't have mattered so
much if I hadn't said 'my dear.'  But I did."
</p>

<p>
Of course our mirth burst forth afresh.  No one
who knew Annabel could have blamed us.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing funny in my calling Cutler 'my
dear,'" she said with dignity; "quite the reverse."
</p>

<p>
"But it was&mdash;it was excruciatingly funny," I
gasped.
</p>

<p>
"I can assure you it was not intentional."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't assure us," I said; "we never for one
mad moment suspected that it was."
</p>

<p>
"And you can now see," continued Annabel, "what
a horror I have of Jumble sales.  It would be terrible
if such a thing occurred again.  And I quite agree
with what you were saying, Reggie, about the Prime
Minister and the Income Tax."
</p>

<p>
For a moment I thought that Annabel had taken
leave of her senses, but on looking round I perceived
that this sudden change of subject was for the benefit
of Jeavons and a footman, who had just entered the
dining-room in order to introduce the pudding and
remove our plates.  My sister usually dropped into
politics, or into other questions equally alien to her
real thoughts and interests when the servants entered
the room, and she believed that they believed that she
was continuing a conversation.  But I feel sure that
they were not so easily taken in&mdash;at any rate, Jeavons
was not; I cannot answer for the credulity of
footmen, but my own private opinion is that they think
exclusively of cricket and football matches, and never
attend to the conversation of their so-called betters
at all.
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for the withdrawal of the listening
retainers, Frank exclaimed: "I've got a ripping idea&mdash;a
million times better than a Jumble Sale.  Let's
have a Pastoral Play."
</p>

<p>
"Papa always said that a shilling in the pound was
far too much, except in time of war," said Annabel,
in a raised tone of voice and with a warning look at
Frank.  Then, as Jeavons thoughtfully banged the
door to show that he was no longer present, she
continued in a softer voice: "Yes, my dear Frank, what
was it you said?  I never like to discuss arrangements
before the servants."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't see any harm in suggesting a Pastoral
Play before them," replied the irrepressible Frank;
"but of course I shouldn't have gone on talking about
the time when you kissed Cutler in the peach-house
as long as they were in the room."
</p>

<p>
Annabel gave a little shriek.  "My dear boy, what
are you talking about?  I didn't kiss Cutler, I only
put my hand upon his shoulder."
</p>

<p>
"It makes a much better tale of it if you say you
kissed him," persisted Frank; "it really does.  I
should tell it like that the next time, if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"I shall do nothing of the kind.  It would sound
so dreadful, and, besides, it wouldn't be true."
</p>

<p>
"Still it makes it much funnier," persisted Frank.
</p>

<p>
"But it couldn't possibly have happened," explained
Annabel.  "I should never have thought of
kissing Reggie on a Sunday afternoon; such an idea
would never have occurred to me.  And if I hadn't
tried to kiss Reggie, I should naturally not have kissed
Cutler.  But do go on with what you were saying
about a Pastoral Play."
</p>

<p>
Annabel was one of those people who, whilst appearing
utterly absent-minded and wrapped up in their
own concerns, "take notice" (as nurses say of
children) far more than one imagines.  Frank's
suggestion had not escaped her.
</p>

<p>
"I think a Pastoral Play would be simply ripping,"
he repeated, "and bring you in no end of money for
your old District Nurse.  Fay and I would get it up
and run it for you, as we were always acting and being
mixed up with theatrical things when Father was alive,
and it would be like old times for us to be on the
stage again, wouldn't it, Fay?"
</p>

<p>
My wife's eyes sparkled.  "<i>Rather</i>!  I should
simply adore it."
</p>

<p>
It was news to me that the twins had been so much
in the theatrical world during their father's lifetime,
and not altogether pleasing news, either.  But, considering
that he had chosen his wife from "the Profession,"
I could hardly be surprised at his familiarity with it.
</p>

<p>
"Then that's settled," exclaimed Frank, as usual
carrying Fay and Annabel with him on the wings of
his enthusiasm.  "It will be the greatest fun in the
world!  We'll get the Loxleys to come and stay here
and help us with the principal parts, and we can train
the choir-boys and the village children to do the crowds
and the dances and things like that.  It will be simply
top-hole."
</p>

<p>
"But where should we have it?" asked Annabel,
breathless with the rapidity of her flight.
</p>

<p>
"In the garden, of course: I'll show you an ideal
spot.  The audience will sit on rows of chairs on the
lawn, and the stage will be on that, raised piece at the
far end which sticks out into the shrubbery, and the
actors will come on from behind the rhododendrons.
</p>

<p>
"And what play shall you act?" asked my sister,
still gasping.
</p>

<p>
"It must be one of Shakspere's," said Arthur; "I
never heard of a Pastoral Play that wasn't
Shakspere's."
</p>

<p>
"And Shakspere's are sufficiently classical and
improving and respectable," Fay chimed in, "to be in
the same <i>galère</i> as the Parish Nurse."
</p>

<p>
Annabel beamed.  "Fay is quite right: it would
never do to have anything that was at all doubtful or
risky in connection with the Parish Nursing Fund;
but Shakspere's Plays almost count as lesson-books,
they are so educational and instructive; they are
regularly studied at girls' schools, and were even in
my schooldays.  I have forgotten it all since, but we
read a good deal of Shakspere when I was at school,
and different girls took the different parts, which made
it so much more interesting."
</p>

<p>
I daren't look at Fay, for fear of seeing and
responding to an irreverent smile.  "Shakespere is
evidently the man for the place," I said.
</p>

<p>
"I always think he was a very clever writer," continued
Annabel, "and nice-looking too, to judge from
his portraits, with quite a distinct look of
Reggie&mdash;especially about the beard."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid the resemblance ended there," I
sighed, "and did not ascend to the brain."
</p>

<p>
"And I always think it is so tiresome," my sister
went on, "of people to say he was the same as Bacon.
If he had been, people would have known it at the
time, and would not have had to wait two or three
hundred years to find it out.  It seems to me a most
absurd idea.  What should you think if two or three
hundred years hence people said that Bernard Shaw
and Mr. Gladstone were the same?"
</p>

<p>
"I should say they were mistaken," I answered.
</p>

<p>
Here Frank put in his oar, and said that Bernard
Shaw was his especial idol, and that therefore such
an accusation on the part of posterity would cause
him the keenest pain.  "I simply adore Bernard
Shaw," he added.
</p>

<p>
"And papa simply adored Mr. Gladstone," said
Annabel; "so that naturally I do not wish to say a
word against either of them.  All I say is that it would
be a mistake to mix them up."
</p>

<p>
The meeting unanimously agreeing with her, we
passed on to the subject in chief.
</p>

<p>
"Which play shall we select?" asked Blathwayte.
</p>

<p>
"We can do either <i>As You Like It</i>, or <i>A Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>," replied Frank.  "Fay and I have
acted in both.  We used to do a lot of that sort of
thing in Father's time, ever since we were quite little.
Mother's sister, Aunt Gertrude, was an actress before
she married, you know, as Mother was, only Mother
was a dancer, and she and Mother used to teach us
to dance and act from our cradles."
</p>

<p>
I had heard a good deal of this aunt from both Fay
and Frank, and I freely admit I was decidedly jealous
both of her and of what she represented.  She was
an actress who had married an Australian squatter,
and she had had more to do with the upbringing of
the twins than their own mother had.  She had been
a second mother to them both before and after their
own mother's death, as the Wildacres frequently
stayed with her and her husband on that far-off
Australian sheep-farm.  I gathered that Wildacre had
put the little money he possessed into his brother-in-law's
farm, and it had repaid him handsomely.  When
he came to England to complete his children's education
(and, incidentally, his own life), the wrench of
parting from their aunt had been as great a sorrow to
the twins as their mother's death.  But I could read
between the lines that his wife's people belonged to
a much lower social stratum than he did himself, and
that he felt it his duty to his children to launch them
on the world in the position to which by right they
belonged.  Therefore he took them from Mr. and
Mrs. Sherard, their maternal aunt and uncle, and left
them to the guardianship of his old college-chum,
Arthur Blathwayte.
</p>

<p>
I knew that it had been&mdash;and still was, as far as
Frank was concerned&mdash;the fixed intention of the twins
to return to Australia to see their beloved aunt as
soon as they came of age and could do as they liked;
but marriage had modified this decision on the part
of Fay; she still, however, cherished a hope of visiting
her maternal relations some time, though I cannot
say that the letters of Mrs. Sherard to her niece
induced me to share this hope.
</p>

<p>
That Mrs. Sherard was still a handsome woman,
her photograph testified; but the refined beauty which
Mrs. Wildacre had not been permitted to survive had
developed&mdash;in the case of her sister&mdash;into something
not far removed from coarseness.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about <i>As You Like It</i>," said Annabel
doubtfully.  "Doesn't a girl dress up as a boy, or
something of that kind in it?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," replied Frank: "Rosalind.  Fay
makes a perfectly spiffing Rosalind.  She played it at
a Pastoral Play some of Father's friends had at
Richmond; and she looked positively ripping in her
green doublet and trunk hose, and little green cap
with a feather in it.  All the girls fell in love with
her."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I could have any doublet or trunk
hose in connection with the Parish Nurse," said
Annabel solemnly; "the Fund is not very popular as
it is, and I couldn't bear to do anything to make it
less so."
</p>

<p>
I laughed at Annabel's way of putting it; but at the
back of my mind I was conscious of a spasm of what
Fay would have called "Kingsnorthism," which
violently protested against the idea of my wife's
appearing in doublet and trunk hose.  "Then what
about <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Fay is awfully good in that, too," replied Frank;
"she plays Titania and I play Puck, and we introduce
a little dance of our own in the middle.  Then Bob
Loxley can play Bottom, and Elsie Hermia and
Mamie Helena; and we can easily get people to take
the other parts.  The choir-boys can do the rest of
the Athenian workmen, and the village children the
rest of the fairies.  They will soon pick it up, when
there's one good actor to lead them."
</p>

<p>
And so, after much consultation among ourselves,
and much searchings of heart on the part of Annabel
as to whether the Parish Nurse would suffer in any
way from this identification of her interests with those
of Shakspere, it was decided that <i>A Midsummer
Night's Dream</i> should be performed in the garden of
the Manor House at the end of July, just before the
time when some of our neighbours flitted to the
seaside for their children's holidays, and others, whose
children were of a larger growth, repaired to shoots
in Scotland.  The Loxleys came for a good long time
(longer, in fact, than Annabel considered necessary),
in order to assist in coaching the village infants in
their parts.  They were good-looking, good-tempered
young people, their looks and their tempers being, in
my humble opinion, superior to their form; but Fay
and Frank thoroughly enjoyed and entered into their
high spirits and youthful pranks.  There was no harm
in them, but they were rather too theatrical for my
provincial taste, and very much too theatrical for
Annabel's and Arthur's.  They brought out a side of
the twins that I had never seen&mdash;that side which had
been fostered by their mother and aunt, and
afterwards indulged by their father, and although it
rejoiced my heart to see my darling so happy and in
such good spirits, I could not altogether stifle a wish
that her tastes and mine were rather more on the
same lines.
</p>

<p>
That, I think, is one of the disadvantages of marrying
late in life: it is so much less easy to adapt oneself
than it was when one was young.  Fay, of course,
was young enough to adapt herself to anything; but
I didn't feel it was playing the game to let her do so,
unless I was prepared to meet her half-way; and I
was confronted by the horrible fact that the half-way
meeting-place is sometimes too long an excursion for
persons of advancing years.  However sincerely we
may wish to do so, we cannot walk so far.
</p>

<p>
I remember once remarking upon this to my sister,
with regret at my loss of adaptability; but she saw
otherwise, and said that one of the comforts of middle
life is that by that time you have found the right
groove and can stick to it, unswayed by any passing
winds of doctrine that may blow your way.  But I
cannot feel like this.  All I know is that I have found
a rut and am unable to climb out of it; but that it is
the right rut or even a desirable rut I have very
serious doubts.
</p>

<p>
I think that this increasing difficulty of altering
ourselves as we grow older applies to men more than
to women, since women are far more adaptable by
nature than we are.  But I very much doubt whether
the adaptability of the middle-aged woman goes far
below the surface.  I feel sure that the bride who
forgot her own people and her father's house was a
very young bride indeed.
</p>

<p>
Thus to my infinite regret I discovered that&mdash;try as
I would&mdash;I could not make myself like the same things
and people and pleasures as Fay liked; and I recognised
that this want of unanimity arose not from the
difference in our ages, but from the difference in our
characters.  I have known parents and children&mdash;who,
though separated by a generation, were similar
in character&mdash;enjoy exactly the same things.  And I
do not think that the difference in years between my
wife and myself affected this diversity of tastes, except
in so far as my age prevented me from becoming one
with her in mind, as I already was in heart.  I could
control my words and my actions, but I could not
help my thoughts and my feelings: nobody can who
is over forty, but I believe that to youth even this
miracle is possible.  The very diversities of character
which make for love militate against friendship, and
therefore the sooner they are done with the better,
after courtship is over and marriage begins.  But the
tragedy of my life lay in the fact that I was too old
to do away with them on my part, and I could not
expect Fay to do for me what I was unable (however
willing, and Heaven knows I was willing enough) to
do for her.  So although&mdash;or rather, because&mdash;I could
not throw myself into her world, I would not ask her
to throw herself into mine.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless I was wrong in this&mdash;I evidently was, as
subsequent events proved, and as Annabel did not
hesitate to point out to me.  But I did what seemed
to me to be right at the time, as I always try to do;
and the fact that what I think right at the time almost
invariably turns out to be wrong afterwards seems
to be rather more my misfortune than my fault: just
part of that instinct of failure which has haunted me
all my life.
</p>

<p>
A strong man&mdash;as Annabel was never tired at pointing
out to me afterwards&mdash;would have made his own
world and his own interest so paramount and absorbing
that his wife would have been compelled, willy-nilly,
to make them hers; but I was not a strong man.
Morever I fully recognised the truth that if you take
anything from anybody, especially anybody young,
you must supply something in its place: nature abhors
a vacuum, and youth abhors it still more; therefore if
I had succeeded in weaning Fay from her passion for
acting and all the pleasure and excitement it involved,
I should have been bound in honour to give her in
its place other and equally absorbing interests, and
these it was not in my power to supply.  What
pleasure could the calm country life of Restham&mdash;which
so exactly suited Annabel and me&mdash;offer to a
youthful and ardent spirit such as Fay's?  None at
all, except of a very passive sort, and the passive tense
has no charm for any one under thirty.  So I had not
the heart to take away from my darling anything that
added to the joy of a life that I feared might prove to
be a little dull for her, and for her dear sake I
swallowed the Loxleys and everything else connected with
amateur theatricals.
</p>

<p>
After weeks of rehearsals of the village children and
a further influx of visitors (old friends of the twins),
to take the part of the Duke and the other mortals,
the great day dawned at last.  It was glorious weather,
as Fay felt sure it would be, for she assured me that
she and Frank were always lucky where weather was
concerned, and there were two performances&mdash;one in
the afternoon, and another by moonlight assisted by
Chinese lanterns.  The places were all filled, and the
audience was most enthusiastic; even Annabel (who
with Arthur and myself had been banished from all
the rehearsals) applauded heartily and beamed with
approbation.  The young local talent had been
admirably trained, and the leading actors performed their
parts with an ease that savoured more of the professional
than of the amateur.  (But this idea I locked
up in my own breast: no expression of it would I
have breathed to Annabel for worlds.)  The village
band, led by the organist on the drawing-room piano,
which had been driven into the shrubbery for the
purpose, conducted itself admirably, and discoursed
music that was undeniably sweet.  And the glamour
of Shakspere and of Summer&mdash;the two greatest
interpreters of beauty the world has ever known&mdash;was upon
everything.
</p>

<p>
But to me the climax of the whole affair&mdash;the crowning
gem of the performance to which all the rest was
but an adequate setting&mdash;was the fairy-dance
introduced by Fay and Frank, as Titania and Puck.  I
shall not attempt to describe it, for how can mere
words convey the indescribable and elusive charm of
the perfection of grace and motion?  It gave me the
same sensations as I had experienced nearly a year
ago when the twins danced the dance of the Needlework
Guild, but greatly intensified, of course, by the
beauty of their dress and the effectiveness of their
surroundings.  It was a sight to fill the onlookers
with the joy of life, and to make the old feel young
again.
</p>

<p>
And as my blood throbbed in my veins at this vision
of the incarnation of youth and joy and all the fulness
of life, I understood why Wildacre had fallen in love
with a dancer.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
THE GARDEN OF DREAMS
</h3>

<p>
After the excitement of the Pastoral Play had
subsided into calm satisfaction with the handsome sum
of money which it had provided for supplying the
future needs of the Parish Nurse, Fay and I went off
for a second little honeymoon by our two selves.  I
urged Annabel to come with us, as she had been
baulked by my marriage of her usual trip abroad with
me in the spring; but she declined, preferring to visit
some old friends of hers who had a place in Scotland.
In the depths of my selfish and undisciplined heart
there was hidden an unholy relief and joy at the
thought of having Fay to myself for a time; but I
loyally strove to hide and quench this unbrotherly
feeling, of which I was glad to know I was thoroughly
ashamed.  How could I shut out my sister from any
happiness of mine, when I was confident that she
would never exclude me from any joy of hers?  Nay,
more than this, I was convinced that Annabel was
incapable of finding happiness, or even pleasure in
anything that she did not share with me.
</p>

<p>
We had decided to go for two or three weeks to an
hotel in a little village on the East Coast, where
Annabel and I had once spent a month some few years
previously, and had found the air wonderfully
invigorating.  It is marvellous, that East Coast air, for
blowing cobwebs out of tired brains, and making the
weak grow strong and the old feel young again.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry that Annabel will not come with us,"
I said to Fay one glorious afternoon in early August
as we were sitting in the garden at home; and my secret
knowledge that I really was not as sorry as I ought
to have been made me say it all the more vehemently:
"she has had a tiring summer, and it would have done
her good."
</p>

<p>
Fay happened to be in one of her unresponsive
moods.  "She is going to Scotland," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I know she is; but she will not find Scotland as
bracing as Bythesea.  In fact, I always think the
Macdonalds' place decidedly relaxing."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she had her choice.  She could have come
with us if she had wanted to.  You asked her."
</p>

<p>
It occurred to me that perhaps Fay was a little
hurt at Annabel's having preferred, for the time being,
the Macdonalds' society to ours; so I hastened to put
this right.  "You mustn't misjudge Annabel, my
darling, and think that her refusal to go with us to
Bythesea shows any want of affection for you, or any
lack of appreciation of your dear society, because I
know it really isn't so."
</p>

<p>
"I never thought anything of the kind," replied
Fay, and her usually gay voice sounded a little flat.
</p>

<p>
"I expect that it was really her unselfishness that
made her refuse to come with us.  Annabel always
puts other people's pleasure before her own.  She
evidently thought we should enjoy a bit of time to
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall, shan't we?"
</p>

<p>
I agreed with Fay to the bottom of my heart; but
I would not let her see that I did.  I felt it would be
disloyal to Annabel.  "Of course we shall, darling;
but we should also have enjoyed it if Annabel had been
there, and I could not bear to feel that we took our
pleasure at the expense of hers."
</p>

<p>
"Still, she may think that a change of society is
rather jolly sometimes.  You are always such a one
for sending out whole families together, Reggie, as if
they were in Noah's Ark."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure Annabel would not think that as far as
you and I are concerned," I answered; "she loves to
be with us."
</p>

<p>
Fay did not reply, so I still thought she was hurt
by Annabel's refusal.  Then suddenly another possible
cause for her lack of enthusiasm struck me, and I
hastened to say: "Would you like us to take Frank
with us, darling?  We certainly will if you would like
it.  It would be rather a good plan, I think, as it
would be so much more cheerful for you."  Of course
that was what had vexed Fay, I thought to myself:
I had asked Annabel to go with us, and had not
thought of asking Frank.  How stupid I had been!
And I tried hard to stifle that selfish longing on my
part to have Fay all to myself.  "By all means let
us take Frank."
</p>

<p>
"But he is supposed to be reading with Mr. Blathwayte."  To
my surprise Fay did not jump at the
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"Bother his reading!  Frank's education doesn't
matter half as much as your pleasure.  I'll go and
ask him at once," I said, attempting to rise from my
seat.
</p>

<p>
But Fay pulled me down again.  "You'll do nothing
of the kind, Reggie.  We won't have either Frank
or Annabel, but only just our two selves, and we'll
talk nonsense and make love to each other all the
time."
</p>

<p>
And then that selfish longing, which I had tried to
stifle so hard, rose up full grown, and I could have
shouted for joy to know that my darling wanted
nobody except me, just as I wanted nobody except her.
There is something shockingly exclusive about love!
</p>

<p>
So Fay and I went to Bythesea together, and had
a glorious time.  The days were not half long enough
for all we had to do and say in them.  We walked by
the blue North Sea, and breathed the strong North
wind, and felt that it was indeed a good thing to be
alive.  Being left exclusively to ourselves, we grew
nearer to each other, and gazed into each other's souls
with no wall of partition between.
</p>

<p>
I have always loved Bythesea, ever since I first went
there with Annabel, and I call it the Place of the Two
Gardens, for with two gardens it is always associated
in my mind.
</p>

<p>
The first garden is the Garden of Sleep.  On the
very edge of the cliff stands&mdash;or rather, there stood
when last I was there, and for aught I know to the
contrary there is still standing to-day&mdash;the tower of a
ruined church.  The rest of the church fell into the
sea years ago, but the tower still remains, its wall on
one side running down sheer with the cliff.  Such of
the churchyard as the encroaching sea has not yet
swallowed lies to the backward of the tower, and all
around it are fields, which in their season are clothed
with scarlet and other delights, for it is the land of
poppies.
</p>

<p>
"It was rather cruel of the sea to wake up all the
sleeping people when they were resting so peacefully,"
said Fay with a shiver, as we sat in the sunshine on
the low bank which encloses what is left of the
churchyard.
</p>

<p>
I hastened to comfort her.  "It didn't wake them
up, sweetheart.  They wakened up long ago, and had
been living and serving and praising somewhere else,
years before the sea washed away their worn-out,
cast-off bodies."
</p>

<p>
"I feel as if they had been drowned," Fay persisted:
"drowned in their sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Silly little child," I said, putting my arms round
her, "to think that the people themselves were washed
away with their poor old bodies!  And they weren't
even the bodies they were wearing at the time: they
were old, worn-out things.  And do you think, too,
that when the church was washed away, the Spirit
that sanctified the church was washed away also?"
</p>

<p>
Fay nestled up to me.  "Of course not."
</p>

<p>
"No," I continued: "as the Spirit which sanctified
this old church still lives and moves and works among
men to-day, so the spirits which inhabited those old
bodies live and move and work to-day, either here on
earth or in other spheres.  The temples made with
hands, and the temples not made with hands, may
pass away and perish; but the Life that transformed
them from mere dwelling-places into temples of God
abides for ever."
</p>

<p>
"You really are very comforting, Reggie, and have
such beautiful thoughts.  I really think you've got an
awfully nice mind&mdash;much nicer than most people's."
</p>

<p>
"Not a millionth part as nice as yours, sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
"Much, <i>much</i> nicer.  I really haven't got a very
nice one, as minds go.  I'm jealous, and selfish and
frivolous, and all sorts of horrid things."
</p>

<p>
I put my hand over the small scarlet mouth.
"Hush, hush!  I cannot allow anybody&mdash;not even you&mdash;to
say a word against my wife."
</p>

<p>
The other garden at Bythesea I called, in opposition
to the Garden of Sleep, the Garden of Dreams: and
a wonderful garden it was.  It was as young as the
other garden was old, and as carefully tended as the
other was neglected.  It also was situated on the edge
of the cliff, and was more like a garden out of the
Arabian Nights which had been called into being in
one night by some beneficent Djin, than a garden in
matter-of-fact England.  It was a garden of infinite
variety and of constant surprises, where nothing grew
but the unexpected; but where the unexpected flourished
in great profusion and luxuriance.  It was a
most inconsequent garden, and to wander through its
changing scenes was like wandering through the exquisite
inconsistencies of a delightful dream.  The dream
began on a velvety lawn, where the velvet was edged
with gay flowers and still gayer flowering shrubs, and
the blue sea made an effective background.  Then it
turned into a formal garden, with paved paths
between the square grass-plots, and a large fountain in
the middle lined with sky-blue tiles, as if a bit of
sky had fallen down to earth and had found earth so
fascinating that it could not tear itself away again.
Then the dream took a more serious turn, and led
along sombre cloisters veiled with creepers.  But it
could not keep serious for long: it soon floated back
into the sunlight, and dipped into a sunk garden paved
with coral and amethyst, as only pink and purple
flowers were allowed to grow therein.  Then it changed
into a rosery where it was always the time of roses,
and where roses red and roses white, roses pink and
roses yellow, ran riot in well-ordered confusion.  Then
the dream took quite another turn, and passed into
a Japanese garden of streams and pagodas and strange
bright flowers, till the dreamer felt as if he were living
on a willow-pattern plate.  But he soon came back to
England again, and found himself in an ideal fruit-garden,
where the pear-trees and the apple-trees were
woven into walls and arches and architraves of green
and gold.  Then a wrought-iron gateway led him still
nearer to the heart of England, for there lay a cricket
field surrounded by large trees: and beyond that again
stretched the grassy alleys and shady paths of
dream-land till they culminated in the very centre of the
dream&mdash;a huge herbaceous border so glorious in its riot
of colour that the dreamer's heart leaped up, like
Wordsworth's, to behold a rainbow: but this time not
a rainbow in the sky, but on the ground.
</p>

<p>
The house belonging to this wonderful garden was
more or less to match.  It had begun life quite as a
small house: but the magic of the garden had lured
it on to venture farther and farther into the enchanted
ground, until finally it grew into a very large house
indeed.  And one could not really blame it for stretching
out longing arms and pointing willing feet towards
all the beauty which surrounded it: one felt that one
would have done exactly the same in its place.
</p>

<p>
Fay and I had many excursions into this modern
fairyland, as the chatelaine thereof was an old friend
of ours who loved to share with others the joy of her
Garden of Dreams; so we went there often.  But one
special excursion stands out in my memory above all
the rest.
</p>

<p>
It was on a Saturday afternoon, and Fay and I had
been having tea in the Garden of Dreams.  It was
glorious weather, and there were many interesting
people there&mdash;as indeed there usually were: choice
spirits flourished in the Garden of Dreams as well as
choice flowers.  We were all grouped about near the
sky-paved fountain after tea, holding sweet converse
with friends new and old, when a man and a woman
came round the corner of the house to greet our
hostess.  They were by no means young; on the sunny
side of fifty, I should say, by which, as an old Bishop
once explained, he meant the side nearest heaven.
Fay would consider them quite old, I felt sure: but I
saw the old youth in them, which I had known when
I was little more than a boy and they in the full zenith
of their successful career, and so they would never
seem old to me.
</p>

<p>
The man had a worn, tired face, and the woman
was plump and cheerful and well dressed.  But the
sight of them carried me back to the time when he
was a rising star in the political firmament, and she
an equally brilliant planet in the constellation of
society: and when I lived in London, and read for the
Bar, and waited for the briefs that never came.
</p>

<p>
His name in those days had been Paul Seaton, and
his success had been brilliant and rapid.  He was a
nobody when he entered Parliament; but his marked
talents and undoubted ability soon made him a name
in the House of Commons, while his marriage to a
woman of position and fortune and considerable
charm assured his position in society.  He was one
of those brilliant young politicians who start life with
the intention of setting the Thames on fire and the
world in order, and exchanging old lamps for new,
wherever they have the chance; but although he
succeeded in attaining a place in the Government, and
then a seat in the Cabinet, the Thames remained too
damp to ignite, the world became increasingly out of
order, and the new lamps lost infinitely more in
magical properties than they gained in additional
candle-power.
</p>

<p>
It would be untrue to say that Paul Seaton's
vaulting ambition "o'er-leaped itself and tumbled down
on t'other."  It did nothing of the kind.  It raised
him to the respected elevation of the high-table, and
bade him feast and make merry above the salt; but
as to those rose-tinted mountain-tops, which he had
beheld in the light of dawn, and which he had then
fondly imagined he was going to scale&mdash;well, they were
practically as far above the high-table as they were
above the ground.
</p>

<p>
The tide which Paul Seaton had taken at the flood
and which had therefore led him on to fortune, in due
season began to ebb: the reforms, on which he had
spent his enthusiastic youth, had either materialised
into the impedimenta of practical politics, or else had
faded into the mist of forgotten dreams: younger men
with newer schemes hurried past him along the road
which seemed to lead to the mountain-tops; and he
sat still and watched them go by, wishing them God-speed
with all his heart, since he also had passed that
way: yet knowing all the time that they too, in their
turn, would watch the rose-colour fade from those
peaks which were inaccessible to the foot of man.
</p>

<p>
So he who had marched to battle with the vanguard
stayed at home by the stuff, and occupied himself in
safeguarding those institutions which he had once
fondly hoped to sweep away.  From a dangerously
daring pioneer he had developed into a steady and
unswerving follower.  He was therefore chosen as
one of the new peers whose creation lends glory to a
Coronation; and he strove as conscientiously to keep
back his Party in the Lords as he had once striven to
urge it forward in the Commons.
</p>

<p>
As for his wife, I could not judge her as dispassionately
as I judged him, since I knew her so much better.
She was considerably older than I, and I adored her
in the days when she was a grown-up young lady, and
I a shy and awkward schoolboy.  She was an orphan
and lived with her uncle, Sir Benjamin Farley: and
Sir Benjamin and my father were old and fast friends.
When I was about fourteen I made up my mind that
when I grew up I would marry the exact counterpart
of Isabel Carnaby, as Mrs. Paul Seaton was called in
that prehistoric time: and after I became a man and
she a married woman, she still ranked among my most
admired friends.  Of late years I had not seen much
of her, she being a busy woman and I an idle man;
but we kept a book-marker in the volume of our
friendship, and always began again exactly where we left
off.  She changed outwardly very little, and inwardly
not at all.  She was the same woman as Mrs. Seaton
that she had been as Isabel Carnaby, and the same as
Lady Chayford that she had been as Mrs. Seaton.
</p>

<p>
Life had not shattered her illusions as it had those
of her husband, because&mdash;even in her young days&mdash;she
had so few to shatter.  She had always been one
of those clear-sighted people who see things pretty
much as they are.  But she too had her disappointments
and her unsatisfied yearnings.  The Coronation
peerage was ordained by an inscrutable Providence to
remain merely a life-peerage.  There were no children
to fill their mother's large heart, and (incidentally) to
carry on their father's well-earned honours.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Isabel had greeted her hostess, she came
straight across the paved court to me with outstretched
hands.  "My dear Reggie, how delightful to see you
again! I had no idea you were here.  And you've
been and got married and done no end of foolish things
since I saw you last, and I know you are dying to tell
me all about them, just as I am dying to hear."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am; and it is more than delightful to
meet again in this unexpected fashion," I responded;
"I had no idea you were here, either."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we aren't really," she replied, sitting down
on the chair next to the one from which I had just
risen to greet her, and which I at once resumed, for
fear somebody should come between us.  "We've
taken a cottage here to which we rush for weary
weekends, and return to town like giants refreshed: and we
only came down to-day.  And now tell me all about
your wife.  I hear she is younger than anybody ever
was before, and much more beautiful, and I am simply
expiring with curiosity to see her."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be only too pleased to introduce her to
you, Lady Chayford."
</p>

<p>
Isabel gave a little scream.  "Oh, for mercy's sake,
don't call me by that absurd name: it makes me feel
like a relic of an effete civilisation.  Of the multitudes
that once called me <i>Isabel</i> there are only a few
survivors left, and I beseech them to continue the habit,
or else my Christian name will be forgotten as
completely as the Christian name of the Sphinx.  And now
let me see if I can guess which is your wife," she went
on, casting her blue eyes over the various groups
dotted about the garden.  "I think it must be that
fairy-like sylph in green: there is nobody else here who in
the least answers to the description I have heard."
</p>

<p>
"You've hit the right nail on the head as usual,"
I replied: "that is Fay."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how lovely she is!  And how clever
it was of you to discover anybody so exquisite!  Very
few men do."
</p>

<p>
"But they all think that they do: which comes to
the same thing as far as they are concerned."
</p>

<p>
"Not they, and you know they don't.  But they
think that we think that they do, and that again
comes to the same thing as far as they are concerned.
And now you shall trundle me round the garden for
fear anybody else should come and talk to us before
you've told me how Annabel is, and how Restham is
looking, and how you like being married, and everything
you've done since I saw you last, and all the
other things that we haven't time to write letters to
each other about, and shouldn't know how to spell if
we tried."
</p>

<p>
So Isabel and I started on a pilgrimage through the
Garden of Dreams, and soon succeeded in bringing
ourselves abreast of each other's times.  She was
always such an easy woman to talk to, in spite of the
fact that she talked almost incessantly herself: but
one felt that she could always listen at the same time.
</p>

<p>
"And so you have taken a country house here," I
said, after we had treated each other to a <i>résumé</i> of
all that had happened to us since we last met.
</p>

<p>
"Only for this year.  We have secured a ninety-nine
years' lease of what is called 'a desirable site,'
and are going to build a house on it after our own
hearts, which will give us unalloyed joy in the building
and acute disappointment when it is finished.  But
the joy will outweigh the disappointment, as it really
always does."
</p>

<p>
"Then shall you spend the autumn here?" I asked
as we wended our way down one of the green aisles
of the fruit garden.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I have been rather seedy&mdash;overdone, you
know, with trying to get more out of life than there
was in it, and pretending to Paul that the Golden Age
was going to begin next week, because he minded so
dreadfully when he thought it wasn't&mdash;so the doctors
ordered me to take draughts of the Elixir of East
Coast air in order to get young again."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry&mdash;very sorry&mdash;to hear you haven't been
well.  I know of old how you have always hated to
be <i>hors de combat</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And I hate it still&mdash;especially when Paul is in
Office, and I want to stand by him and help him.  But
for a long time I, who so wanted to 'serve,' was
obliged&mdash;like Milton&mdash;to 'stand and wait': and even
that I had to do lying down!  But now I am all right
again, and we are going to have a permanent country
house, so that the next time I have to 'stand and
wait' I can do it in the garden."
</p>

<p>
"And where is the desirable site?" I cried.
</p>

<p>
She named a place about twenty miles from Restham.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what luck for us!" I cried.  "You will be
within easy motoring distance."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, easy enough when you want to see us, and
not too easy if you don't.  We seem to want a house
of our own in which to spend our declining years,
surrounded by all the fads that we most affect: and
we can't find them quite all in houses built by other
people.  Of course we shan't find them all in the house
we build ourselves, but then we shall only have
ourselves to blame, and that makes one so much more
merciful and lenient.  We couldn't get a freehold site
that was exactly what we both wanted, and as we
have no children it doesn't signify: as a matter of
fact, a leasehold peerage would have done just as well
for us."
</p>

<p>
I noted the faint quiver in her voice with a pang of
sympathy.  I too felt that life would never be quite
complete as long as Ponty reigned alone in the old
nursery at Restham.
</p>

<p>
"I was saying the other day to a woman I know
that we had taken the place on a ninety-nine years'
lease," Isabel went on, "and she said, 'Only ninety-nine
years, Lady Chayford?  I heard it was nine
hundred and ninety-nine!'  'Well,' I answered, 'you
see my husband and I are no longer young: had we
been, of course we should have taken it on a nine
hundred and ninety-nine years' lease, as you suggest:
but at our age we think ninety-nine will see us
out.'  Did you ever know such an ass?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed.  "People really are very idiotic.  It is
a pity we can't tell them so, and then they might
improve.  Nobody tells us of our faults after we grow
up, so how can we be expected to cure them?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't they?" said Isabel.  "Wait till you've
been married a little longer."
</p>

<p>
"I see you are as great a cynic as ever," I retorted.
"Time doesn't seem to have mellowed you at all!
But, joking apart, I do think it is a pity that
grown-up people won't stand being told of their faults."
</p>

<p>
"But they do stand it quite well&mdash;in fact, they
rather enjoy it; provided, of course, that you never
tell them of those they've really got.  For instance,
I was quite pleased when you said Time hadn't
mellowed me&mdash;knowing all the while that my heart is
really of the consistency of an over-ripe banana."
</p>

<p>
Again I laughed with pleasure to find her so little
altered by time and circumstance, and then we ceased
to talk of our private affairs and turned our attention
to the affairs of our neighbours, discussing what had
happened respecting them since we saw each other
last&mdash;who had died and who had lived, and who had
married wisely and who not so well.  And then we
went on to public events, and discussed the divisions
in our midst at home, and the war-clouds already
gathering in the skies abroad.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we live in stirring times," said Lady Chayford,
as we retraced our steps homewards through the
Garden of Dreams, having settled the fate of nations:
"and I'm afraid they are going to stir more and more.
I don't like living in stirring times.  They don't suit
me at all.  I am getting too old for them, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"I don't agree with you," I replied, "either about
you being too old or the times being too stirring.  We
live in great times, and there are still greater ones
coming."
</p>

<p>
Isabel shook her head.  "I dare say: but they'll
smell awfully of machinery.  The world is growing
far too mechanical and scientific, and is always inventing
new diseases and fresh sources of danger.  I wish
I'd lived before aeroplanes and pyorrhoea were
invented!  Nobody ever heard of such things when I
was a girl."
</p>

<p>
"I envy the people who are young nowadays," I
admitted, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious, Reggie, I don't!  I pity them because
they never knew the glories of the 'eighties and
the 'nineties: those dear old frivolous, uneventful days,
when everybody thought that the last word had been
said about everything, and that a further extension
of the franchise was the only weapon still left in Fate's
armoury: when we fondly believed that wars had
died with the Napoleons, and invasions had gone out
of fashion with the curfew-bell and William the
Conqueror.  Yet as soon as the sky grew pink with dawn
of a new century, that tiresome South African War
began: and now scaremongers introduce an invasion
of England into the realm of practical politics!"
</p>

<p>
"But there were wars even in those days," I argued.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but only 'old, unhappy, far-off things,' that
confined themselves to the newspapers.  We never
knew the real taste of war&mdash;at least, I didn't&mdash;until
the South African tragedy: and now everybody seems
to think there'll be a great European War before very
long, with us in the thick of it, and the German
Emperor trying to be William the Conqueror the Second.
Oh, Reggie, don't you wish we could go back to the
dear old comfortable, self-satisfied 'eighties?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not: I wouldn't do so for worlds.  My
wife wasn't born in those days, and I should hate to
miss her."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, how procrastinating of her!  She made
a mistake to put things off for so long.  But I don't
mind giving up the 'eighties for the sake of you and
your unborn wife, and only going back as far as the
'nineties.  As a matter of fact, the 'nineties were even
jollier than the 'eighties, and had a fuller flavour."
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "No: Fay was only a child in
the 'nineties, and I want her as a woman.  Besides,
I didn't know of her existence then."
</p>

<p>
"Then if you didn't know of her existence you
couldn't mind missing her.  But have it your own
way.  Revel in your seething young century as much
as you like, but leave me my beloved Nineteenth.  I
was what used to be called <i>fin de siècle</i> in those days,
and a jolly nice thing it was to be!"
</p>

<p>
"It is strange how there always do seem to be wars
and tumults and things of that kind at the beginning
of a century," I said; "as if centuries experienced the
symptoms of youth and age, as we do."
</p>

<p>
"Then let me again be <i>fin de siècle</i> in my next
incarnation!" exclaimed Isabel.  "I shall avoid having
an incarnation when there is a new century, just as
in the country one avoids having a party when there
is a new moon."
</p>

<p>
"But you want to go on somewhere, don't you&mdash;either
here or elsewhere?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do: I have not the slightest intention
of fizzling out.  I shall have 'To be continued'
engraved upon my tombstone.  And I really don't feel
that I've had half enough out of this life yet: I should
like one or two more turns before I go off to something
higher&mdash;provided, of course, that they are not
put in at the beginning of a century.  And now we
are back among the haunts of men, and the ruins of
extinct tea-tables," added Isabel, as we ascended the
steps from the sunk garden and came back to the
group assembled on the lawn: "so you must introduce
me to your wife at once, and let me tell her how
unlucky she is to have missed the 'eighties, and how
lucky she is to have found you."
</p>

<p>
Which I accordingly did, and was rejoiced to see
that my old friend and my new wife got on together
like a house on fire.
</p>

<p>
The friendship between the two progressed so
rapidly that when I was obliged to return home the
following week in order to attend to some rather
important business connected with the Kent County
Council, Fay stayed on for a few days with the
Chayfords in their cottage at Bythesea.  I did not like
being separated from my darling even for that short
time; but I felt that no young woman at the outset
of life could have a wiser or a better friend than she
whom I had first known as Isabel Carnaby.
</p>

<p>
When I reached home I found Annabel established
there to welcome me: but whether this premature
return from Scotland proved that she loved the
Macdonalds less or me more, I was not able to
determine.
</p>

<p>
She was naturally immensely interested in my meeting
with the Chayfords, and very anxious to know how
Time had dealt with Isabel and her husband.
</p>

<p>
"I never altogether approved of that marriage,"
she remarked; "it was one of those love-in-a-cottage
sort of affairs which are so apt to turn out
uncomfortable and inconvenient."
</p>

<p>
"Still, the cottage happened to be a good-sized
house in Prince's Gate, if you remember."
</p>

<p>
"I know that: but all the same Isabel had much
better have married Lord Wrexham when she had the
chance.  I always thought him such a very pleasant
person besides being a Prime Minister, and so much
more suited to her than Mr. Seaton.  And she behaved
so badly to him too, which was so very wrong
of her.  I never cared much for Mr. Seaton myself; but
then I never do care much for people with long noses.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that Isabel, though she didn't love it
little, loved it long," I said feebly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, what a silly joke!  And all the same,
I don't think you cared much for Mr. Seaton, either."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did.  I own I did not like him as much as
I liked Isabel, but I had a great admiration for his
abilities and a great respect for his character."
</p>

<p>
But Annabel shook her head.  "He was too clever:
I never could understand what he was talking about:
he was far too clever for you and me."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I retorted; "speak for yourself."  But
I knew what Annabel meant.
</p>

<p>
The day of Fay's return came at last: and I decided
to meet her at Liverpool Street Station with the car,
and motor her down home in the cool of the evening,
as it was a lovely ride when once you had left London
behind you, and I knew my darling would enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
Strange to say the same idea occurred to Annabel.
"Why don't you motor up to town yourself and call
at Gamage's for some things I want for the
Sunday-school Prize-giving, and then Fay could motor back
with you, and her maid could bring the luggage on
by train?  I like the prizes I get at Gamage's better
than any I get anywhere else.  I could give you the
list of exactly what I want, and it wouldn't take you
long to select them."
</p>

<p>
I duly obeyed my sister's behest, and went on to
meet Fay at Liverpool Street.  Her dear face lighted
up with joy at the sight of me, and the train had
hardly stopped before she was out of her carriage and
into my arms.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how darling of you to come all this
way to meet me, and what a heavenly drive home
we shall have together!" she exclaimed, fairly
hugging me with delight when I had expounded to her
my plan.  "It was just like you to contrive such a
lovely treat for me!"
</p>

<p>
I felt this was an auspicious occasion to put in a
word for my sister.  "It was Annabel's idea," I said
(as indeed it was, as well as my own); "she thought
you would enjoy the motor ride more than the railway
journey."  I saw no necessity for diminishing the
credit due to Annabel by dragging in any mention of
the Sunday-school prizes.
</p>

<p>
Fay turned away so quickly to see if her maid had
got all the packages safe that she hardly seemed to
hear what I had said.  At any rate, she made no reply
to it, so I concluded she had not heard.
</p>

<p>
Annabel's motor ride did not turn out such a great
success after all.  I suppose it was too tiring for my
fragile darling after her journey, and her joy at the
sight of me was so exuberant that I did not realise at
first how done-up she was.  During the long drive
home she hardly spoke, and her weary little face grew
whiter and whiter, until when at last we did reach
Restham Manor she insisted on going straight to bed,
whilst Annabel and I had a dreary dinner by ourselves
downstairs.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
ANNABEL'S WARNING
</h3>

<p>
We had a very quiet and peaceful autumn after
Frank went back to Oxford. But that Fay missed
him I am sure, as she was not nearly so gay and
light-hearted as she had been during the long vacation.
But although this grieved me, I was not surprised at
it: after all, Annabel and I were but dull old fogies
compared with Frank and Fay.
</p>

<p>
The autumn was always a pleasant time to me, as
I was extremely fond of both shooting and hunting:
and now that Fay as well as Annabel was sitting by
the fireside that beckoned me home after my long
day's sport, my contentment was great indeed. My
happiness would have been complete if only I had felt
equally sure of Fay's.
</p>

<p>
That want of self-confidence which I must have
inherited from my mother, since neither my father nor
Annabel ever had a trace of it, made it impossible for
me to believe in my own power of filling my young
wife's life with joy and interest; but I had great faith
in the soothing powers of Annabel, to say nothing of
the increasingly absorbing little pleasures and interests
which go to make up the sum of country life. Surely
all these were enough to make any woman content.
And in the depths of my soul I cherished an unspoken
hope that there was a greater and more satisfying joy
still in store for Fay in the dim and distant future&mdash;that
highest joy of all, without which no woman's
life is complete, and the lack of which had created the
only cloud that ever dimmed the brightness of Isabel
Chayford's blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
So I possessed my soul in patience, and prayed that
in the years to come my darling might be as happy
as she deserved and as I desired her to be.  And I
loved her so well that I was content to stand aside, if
I thought others could succeed where I had failed.
I only prayed that she might be happy: I never added
a petition that her happiness might be found in
me.  It would have seemed to me presumption to
do so.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I was wrong in this: I dare say I was, as
I nearly always am.  It is the people who make the
greatest demands that get the largest supplies.  But
it was not in me either to make the one or to claim
the other; and we can only act according to our
kind.
</p>

<p>
In looking back on past events I once used to think:
"How much better things would have turned out, if
only I had acted differently."  But as I grew older
and wiser I changed the formula to: "How much
better things would have turned out, if only I had
had the power to act differently."  And at the back
of my mind I knew that I never had had the
power.
</p>

<p>
Of course this does not apply to wrongdoing: we
are always able to avoid that if we wish.  We are
to blame for our sins, as they are caused by temptations
which are outside us, and therefore possible to
be resisted; but I do not think we are to blame for
our blindness and our blunders, as they arise from our
own limitations, which are inside us and part of ourselves.
If I had my life to live over again, I hope&mdash;and
believe&mdash;that I should not repeat the wrong things
I have done; but I very much fear that I should repeat
all the stupid things, given that I remained myself.
Grace and Wisdom are both gifts from on high: but
Grace is a far more common gift than Wisdom.
</p>

<p>
There was one thing that gave me great pleasure in
that autumn, and that was the increasing friendliness
between Fay and Annabel.  Now that Fay was so
much quieter, she naturally shocked Annabel much
less frequently than she did in her high-spirited moods,
though I adored Fay when she was wild and reckless
and defiant, I knew that such qualities were far
from exercising an ingratiating effect upon Annabel.
</p>

<p>
But when Frank came home for Christmas things
once more began to hum; and he and Fay threw themselves
with great zest into a succession of theatrical
entertainments.  Again the Loxleys invaded the
house, and there were plays acted for the villagers and
for our personal friends.  And this time the plays were
not Shakspere's.  Fay and Frank always took the
leading parts, and it amazed me to note how very
quickly and with how little apparent trouble they
learnt a new piece.  But the histrionic art was in their
blood, and all things connected with acting came easy
to them.
</p>

<p>
It was the very opposite with Annabel and me.  In
our early youth anything connected with the theatre
had been <i>Anathema</i> to our extremely Evangelical
parents: and although in later years we so far
broadened down as to be able now and again to attend the
theatre in comparative spiritual comfort, there was
always a lurking feeling at the back of our minds&mdash;and
in Annabel's mind it frequently did more than
merely lurk&mdash;that we were meddling with the accursed
thing.  Of course, my mature judgment repudiated
and laughed at this archaic idea; but in nine cases out
of ten early training is stronger than mature, judgment,
and I was one of the nine.
</p>

<p>
Therefore in the secret recesses of my heart there
sprang up a tiny doubt as to whether all this theatrical
excitement was good for Fay.  Naturally I did all in
my power to trample upon this horrid little weed, and
hid it away in darkness where neither light nor air
could encourage its unhealthy growth; but suddenly
Annabel threw all my precautions to the wind by
remarking one day&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Reggie dear, I don't want to interfere, and I
suppose it really is no concern of mine, although
everything that concerns you must concern me: but do you
think it is wise to allow this acting spirit to take such
possession of Fay?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," I said coldly:
although I did know perfectly well.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I don't want to say a word against
Fay&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," I interrupted, "and if you did,
of course I should not listen."  By this time I was
striding up and down the great hall, while Annabel
sat placidly by the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Reggie, you are losing your temper, and it
is such a pity to do that when I am only speaking for
your good and Fay's.  But you know as well as I do
that her mother and her mother's people were on the
stage."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what that has got to do with it," I
retorted hotly.
</p>

<p>
But Annabel remained unperturbed.  "Then it is
because you won't see.  Everybody knows that what
is bred in the bone comes out in the flesh."
</p>

<p>
"And I think it is horrid of you to throw the poor
child's mother in her teeth in this way," I went on,
lashing myself into greater fury.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not throwing her mother in her teeth&mdash;I'm
only throwing her into yours, which is quite a different
thing, and can't possibly hurt you as you never saw
her," replied Annabel, with her usual clearness of
thought and confusion of expression.  "I shouldn't
think of mentioning her mother's profession to Fay.
There's nobody thinks more of the sacredness of
motherhood than I do: I couldn't bear anybody to say
even now that poor mamma hadn't any spirit or any
go in her, though you and I know perfectly well that
she hadn't, and that you are exactly like her in this
respect.  But I cannot see that there is anything
particularly sacred about a mother-in-law&mdash;and
especially a mother-in-law that you have never seen.  And
although Fay is a married woman she is really only a
child, and an orphan at that: and I cannot help feeling
that you and I, who are so much older, have a sort
of responsibility about her."
</p>

<p>
"I, perhaps; but hardly you."  I was still very
angry.
</p>

<p>
Annabel's temper, however, continued unruffled.
"That is so," she said, "but as you have never
accepted your responsibilities, and never will, I am
obliged to take them on to my shoulders, as I always
have done.  If Fay were an older woman, I shouldn't
bother about her, but should leave her to shift for
herself: and if you had ever managed your own affairs,
I should expect you to manage them now.  But as it
is, I cannot see a young girl going into danger and
temptation under my own roof, and not stretch out a
helping hand to her."
</p>

<p>
I jibbed at Annabel's reference to her own roof, but
did not say anything.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," she went on, "Fay told me that if she
hadn't married, she and Frank would have gone on
the stage as soon as they were of age and independent;
and that shows the theatrical craving is in them
both."
</p>

<p>
I wished with all my heart that Fay had confided
this idea to me instead of to Annabel; but it was
impossible to teach my darling wisdom. And even if
it had been possible, grey heads on green shoulders
are not an attractive combination. I loved Fay just
as she was, and would not have had her different for
anything, but I could not deny that that particular
remark of hers to Annabel might have been omitted
with advantage.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure that Frank has a very good influence
upon her," my sister continued, looking thoughtfully
into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so it's Frank's turn now," I replied, viciously
kicking back a log of wood that slightly protruded
from the hearth: "I thought you were so fond of
Frank."  Because I was jealous of Frank, I was all
the more determined to do him justice.
</p>

<p>
"So I am, Reggie; extremely fond: but being fond
of people doesn't blind me to their faults."
</p>

<p>
I could testify to the truth of this. "Far from it,"
I muttered.
</p>

<p>
"The fact that I am fond of Frank does not prevent
my seeing that he is volatile and flighty and lacking
in any sense of responsibility: any more than the fact
that I am fond of you prevents my seeing that you
are over-sensitive and over-indulgent, and have so
exaggerated a sense of responsibility that you are
frightened of it, and therefore inclined to shirk it."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, don't mind me!" I interrupted, with a
harsh laugh. The fact that I knew my sister was
speaking the truth in no way added to my relish for
her remarks.
</p>

<p>
"Reggie, don't be foolish!  I am not thinking about
either you or Frank just now, but about Fay: and
I feel bound to say that I do not think it does her
any good to be so much under Frank's influence."
</p>

<p>
"He provides the only bit of young life she sees, and
I want her to have as much youthful society as she
can get.  Does it never strike you that you and I
are somewhat old and dull companions for a girl of
nineteen?"  I still struggled against my own inclinations.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it strikes me," replied Annabel in her
smooth and even tones: "it struck me so forcibly at
one time, if you remember, that I tried to dissuade
you from marrying her.  I thought she was much too
young for you, and said so; and I think so still.  But
that's all over and done with.  You have married her,
and you've got to take the consequences, just as she
has got to take the consequences of marrying you.
You knew you were taking a young wife, and she knew
she was taking a middle-aged husband; and it is
nonsense now to be struck all of a heap with surprise to
find that you and she are not identical in tastes and
interests.  I knew you wouldn't be, and you ought to
have known it too."
</p>

<p>
"But it so happened that we loved each other," I
retorted drily.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you did: otherwise you wouldn't have
been so foolish as to marry each other.  But marrying
one another hasn't altered your own selves.  It
always amazes me to see how people imagine that a
quarter-of-an-hour's service in church will entirely
change the characters of a man and a woman.  How
could it?  Especially as they are generally quite
opposite characters, or they wouldn't have fallen in love
with one another at all.  You and Fay had the idea
that the minute you put the wedding-ring on to her
finger you would become eighteen and she would
become forty-two."
</p>

<p>
"In which case we should have been exactly as far
apart as we are at present.  I cannot see that the
fulfilment of that idea would have mended matters
at all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, how tiresome you are in always
tripping people up!  You know perfectly well what I
mean.  My point is that having persisted, in opposition
to my advice, in marrying a young girl, your duty
is to make her as happy and contented as possible."
</p>

<p>
I was amazed at the incapacity of the feminine mind
to apprehend justice.  "That is what I am trying to
do," I replied; "and what you are abusing me for
doing."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  You are trying to make her happy
apart from you: you are not trying to make yourself
the principal factor in her happiness.  You are
blundering&mdash;as you have so often blundered&mdash;through
too great unselfishness.  You are standing aside for
fear you should cast a shadow over her pleasure: and
standing aside is not at all the proper attitude for
a husband.  If you'd been so set on standing aside,
you should have stood aside altogether and not married
her: but having married her, the time for standing
aside has gone by."
</p>

<p>
Indignant as I was I could not help admiring
Annabel's power of grasping a situation.  In ordinary
conversation she often appeared <i>distraite</i>&mdash;at times
almost stupid; but when once her bed-rock of
common sense was touched, her judgment was
excellent.
</p>

<p>
"For my part, as you know," she continued
inexorably, "I do not approve of old men marrying
young wives.  But if they do so, the wife must not
take her own young way and leave the husband to
take his old one.  They must merge, and hit on a
comfortable <i>via media</i>, or whatever it is called in
Latin.  You are letting Fay go her own way too much,
Reggie: and mark my words&mdash;you will live to regret
it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't agree with you," I said shortly, once more
venting my righteous indignation on the smouldering
logs in the great fire-place.
</p>

<p>
"Don't do that, Reggie," said Annabel in her most
elder-sisterly tone: "you'll burn holes in the bottom
of your boot, besides sending sparks all over the
carpet.  And I know I'm right, whether you agree
with me or whether you don't.  The first thing you
have got to do is not to have Frank here so much.
Let him go back to live with Mr. Blathwayte at the
Rectory."
</p>

<p>
"I shall do nothing of the kind," I retorted angrily:
"I couldn't very well send away Frank as long as
you are living here!  What is sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander: and my wife's brother has as
much right here as my sister."
</p>

<p>
"What utter nonsense!" exclaimed Annabel; "there
is no parallel between the two cases.  This is my
home: I have a right to be here; but Frank is only
a guest partaking of your hospitality, and therefore
has no claim to stay on longer than you
choose."
</p>

<p>
This was more than I could stand.  So as I did not
want a final rupture with my sister, I strode out of
the hall, and flung myself into the library.  The fact
that in my inmost heart I wanted Frank out of the
house made me all the more determined not to send
him.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in my life I was furious with
Annabel.  How dared she try to come between my
wife and me?&mdash;I asked myself in my rage.  Yet all
the time my better self whispered to me that it was
not fair to accuse Annabel of trying to separate us:
according to her lights she was doing her best to keep
us together.
</p>

<p>
But on another score I felt that I did well to be
angry.  Her last remark had put my back up with
a vengeance.  I should have been within my rights
had I allowed Annabel to leave the Manor on the
occasion of my marriage&mdash;as indeed she herself had
suggested: I should not have been in any way behaving
shabbily to her had I adopted this suggestion:
but I felt I could not do it after all the years that
she and I had lived there together.  But the fact that
Fay and I had not the heart to turn her out in no
way altered the truth that it was a favour on our
part to keep her in.  And she ought not to have
forgotten this, I kept repeating to myself, or to have
regarded our kindness as something to which she was
entitled, and which&mdash;in my present fury&mdash;I considered
she had abused.
</p>

<p>
It is strange how quickly a favour develops into a
right.  We show a kindness to some one, and the first
time it is received with gratitude: the second time
it is accepted as a matter of course: and the third
time we are given to understand that any deviation
from its accustomed rendering would be regarded as
a cause of justifiable offence.
</p>

<p>
There is another problem which has always puzzled
me, and which I have never been able to explain: and
that is that we all behave so much better to other
people than other people behave to us.  It would seem
as if there must be a converse to this, to set the balance
right; but there isn't; or, at any rate, nobody that
I ever knew has been able to find it.  I have never yet
met the man or the woman who, in common parlance,
got as good as they gave.  So I have no doubt that
while I was aghast at Annabel's ingratitude to me, she
was equally aghast at my ingratitude to her.  Such
is that queer compound which we call human nature.
</p>

<p>
And as I mused upon these mysteries my anger
gradually evaporated; and when its departing mists
cleared away, I tried to look at the whole matter
calmly and dispassionately.
</p>

<p>
An old friend of mine used to say: "If any one
says anything disagreeable to you, see what good you
can get out of it.  You have had the pain of it: so
don't dismiss it from your mind until you have got
the profit as well."
</p>

<p>
Therefore I set about seeing what profit I could
derive from my sister's most unpleasant remarks.
</p>

<p>
Although she had irritated me almost beyond endurance,
I knew that Annabel possessed too much sound
sense for her opinion to be lightly set aside.  Her
words were worthy of consideration, even if consideration
did not induce me to agree with them.  So I
considered them with as much impartiality as I could
muster at the moment.
</p>

<p>
I was perfectly aware that certain kinds of men
have sufficiently strong personalities to make marriage
with them a profession in itself&mdash;a profession absorbing
enough to occupy a wife's entire time and
thoughts.  But I was not that kind of man; and it
was no use pretending that I was.
</p>

<p>
I hesitate before setting up my humble opinion in
opposing that of Shakspere: but I cannot believe that
to "assume a virtue if you have it not" is at all a
wise course to pursue: for the reason that every
quality has its corresponding defect, and one is so
apt to assume the defect and to leave out the quality.
When old women pose as young ones, they assume the
follies of youth without its compensating charms: when
dull men set up as wits, they indulge in the gaseousness
of repartee without its accompanying sparkle.
Therefore it was of no use for me to act as if I were
an interesting or absorbing husband, while all the time
I was only a rather dull and very devoted one.  I
felt it was not in me to be a profession for any lively
and intelligent woman.  I was only fit for a pastime&mdash;or
at best a hobby.
</p>

<p>
Now if Annabel had been a man, she would have
been quite different.  She would have married a quiet,
pliable sort of girl, and then would have moulded the
girl's character, and filled the girl's thoughts, and
ordered the girl's actions, until the girl's whole world
would have been summed up in Annabel.  And the
girl would have been quite content and happy, and
would have asked for nothing else.  But it was out of
my power to do any of these things.  Again I was
brought face to face with my old mistake of being
the boy and letting Annabel be the girl: it seemed as
if I should never outlive the consequences of that early
error.
</p>

<p>
Things being as they were&mdash;that is to say, I being
the quiet and uninteresting person that I was&mdash;I did
not see that I was justified in taking away from Fay
any legitimate source of pleasure and interest in her
life which might in some way make up for my limitations
and deficiencies.
</p>

<p>
So having carefully weighed Annabel's most
unpalatable suggestions, I decided to take no notice of
them&mdash;at any rate, for the present: but to leave my
darling to go her own sweet way, unfettered by the
rules and restrictions of a middle-aged husband.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
DARKENING SKIES
</h3>

<p>
Although I had made up my mind to ignore
Annabel's warning as far as action went, I could not
altogether ignore it in thought, and I was convinced
in my own mind that she was right as to Frank.  I
could not close my eyes to the fact that he was using
his influence over Fay&mdash;which undoubtedly was very
great&mdash;to draw her away from me.
</p>

<p>
He had, not unnaturally, been jealous of me ever
since his sister began to care more for me than she
did for him.  I think most brothers&mdash;and especially
most twin-brothers&mdash;would have felt the same in the
circumstances; and I, for one, did not blame him as
I&mdash;in my turn&mdash;was jealous of him.  But with most
brothers it would have stopped there: few would have
taken the awful responsibility of endeavouring to
come between their married sisters and those sisters'
husbands.  But that was where Frank Wildacre
differed from the ordinary run of mortals; that was
where the elfin strain in him came in.  His utter lack
of any sense of responsibility, and his absolute
disregard of consequences, sometimes seemed to me
hardly human: just as his husky, girlish voice and his
delicate complexion made it impossible to realise that
he was now less of a boy than of a man, and therefore
ought to think as a man, and to put away childish
things.  He must have known&mdash;for he was no longer
a child, although he behaved as such&mdash;that a permanent
estrangement between Fay and myself could only
end in misery for her, and therefore, indirectly, for
him.  For my feelings in the matter I did not expect
him to show any regard; although I had been sincerely
attached to and attracted by him, I had sufficient
acuteness to perceive that he had no real affection
for me, or indeed for anybody except himself&mdash;unless,
perhaps, for his sister; and his love for her was entirely
a selfish love.  I do not believe he cared an atom about
her happiness, except in so far as it ministered to his
own: but I should have credited him with sufficient
sense to realise that Fay's marriage was, on the whole,
a good thing for him as well as for her from a worldly
point of view: and Frank was certainly not accustomed
to look at anything from an altruistic standpoint.
</p>

<p>
Had his jealousy goaded him to oppose Fay's marriage
in the first instance, I could have understood it.
But it did not.  It was only when the thing was a
<i>fait accompli</i> and my darling's fate was sealed
that&mdash;with Puck-like perversity&mdash;he set about making her
dissatisfied with it.
</p>

<p>
Herein he was&mdash;as might have been expected&mdash;the
exact opposite of Annabel.  Before I had asked Fay
to marry me, my sister tried her utmost to dissuade
me from so doing: but when once we were married,
she did all in her power&mdash;even to the point of nearly
quarrelling with me&mdash;to prevent us from drifting
apart.  But then there was nothing impish or
Puck-like about Annabel.
</p>

<p>
I admit that I watched Frank's veiled antagonism
to myself with increasing uneasiness.  I realised the
strength of the call of kinship too fully to be able to
defy its influence: and as I gradually came to understand
that this influence was hostile to my life's
happiness, I trembled at what suffering might be in store for
myself, and for Fay who was dearer to me than myself.
</p>

<p>
Although I would not have admitted it to Annabel
for worlds, I could no longer shut my eyes to the fact
that this passion for everything connected with the
stage was gradually coming between my wife and
myself: and&mdash;now that Annabel had told me of Fay's
former ambition to take up acting as a profession&mdash;I
was haunted by a horrible suspicion that my wife had
returned to her first love, and now wished that she had
chosen the stage instead of me.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when Annabel talked of Fay's passion for
the stage becoming a menace to our conjugal happiness,
she confined that menace to the admiration and
excitement which are an inevitable accompaniment of
a theatrical career.  She never saw the subtler and,
to my mind, the more real danger of the love of art
for art's sake, which exists in the breast of the true
artist.  It would never have occurred to my sister to
imagine the possibility of any woman's caring more
for her art than she cared for her husband: such things
did not occur in the Victorian days wherein Annabel
was brought up.  In those dark ages it not
infrequently happened that a man thought more about
his profession or his business than he did about his
wife: but that was humbly accepted as a matter of
course by the meek helpmeet of those simpler times.
"She could not understand, she loved," was the
typical attitude of the wives of those days: and the
possibility of the masculine mind failing to understand
anything was a thing undreamed of in mid-Victorian
philosophy.
</p>

<p>
But the things that satisfied our grandmothers will
not satisfy our wives; and the sooner we remnants of
a bygone century learn that fact, the better for all
concerned: I am not saying that this awakening of
the Sleeping Beauty is either a good thing or a bad
thing: I do not feel competent to lay down the law
on such a big question: I only say that now she is
awake, it is absurd to treat her as if she were still
asleep.  My own personal opinion is that the awakening
of the sex as a whole makes for the improvement
of Woman's character, but militates against her
happiness, though I cherish a larger hope that it will
finally conduce to her higher and truer happiness in
the future.  Still, even if it doesn't ever conduce to
her happiness, the thing is there and has to be
reckoned with.  Childhood is the happiest part of life;
but that is no excuse for arrested development.
Woman at last has grown up, and has to be treated
as a grown-up person and no longer as a child.  At
least that is how I look at the matter: but I really
know so little about it that my opinion is neither here
nor there.  What I do know is that women nowadays
have their interests and their professions the same as
men have, and therefore it is just as likely for a woman
to set art before her husband as it is for a man to set
science before his wife&mdash;and, in my opinion, much
more dangerous, as a man has by nature a far stronger
sense of proportion than a woman has.  The Victorian
wife, who came second to her husband's profession,
did not really suffer much; but the twentieth-century
husband, who comes second to his wife's art, will
probably suffer very much indeed, since a man's heart
is composed of water-tight compartments, and a
woman's is not.
</p>

<p>
Therefore I did not fear (as I knew Annabel did)
that all this acting would end in Fay's caring for some
younger man more than she cared for me&mdash;not because
I had a high opinion of myself, but because I
had such a high opinion of Fay: what I did fear was
that all this acting would end in Fay's caring more
for the thing itself than she cared for me; and I knew
that in the case of a really good woman a thing is a
far more dangerous rival to her husband than a
person, simply because such rivalry is without sin.
</p>

<p>
The more I thought about Annabel's hint, and the
more firmly I decided to take no notice of it, the
deeper grew my conviction that my sister was right,
though not quite in the way that she thought she
was: and I gradually came to the conclusion that it
was the love of acting in itself&mdash;and not any excitement
incidentally connected with it&mdash;that was coming
between myself and Fay.  Moreover, behind this
depressing conviction there lurked a horrible and as yet
unformulated fear that even yet Fay might fulfil her
original intention, and take to the stage as a profession.
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand it went to my heart to
contemplate the mere possibility of casting the
slightest cloud on my darling's present happiness.  How
could I injure the thing that I so passionately loved?
Surrounded by the youthful, not to say rowdy,
atmosphere of Frank and the Loxleys, Fay bubbled
over with jest and jollity, and was once more the
high-spirited, laughter-loving fairy that she had been when
I saw her first.  It might be better for her in the long
run, and it certainly would be much better for me,
if this new and absorbing interest were nipped in the
bud.  Nevertheless I felt it was not in me to nip it
as long as it made my darling so light of heart.
</p>

<p>
Annabel's other suggestion I put away from me at
once without even playing with it.  I knew it was out
of the question for me to suggest that Fay's brother
should cease to make his home at the Manor as long
as my sister lived there.  Such a course was more than
repugnant to me&mdash;it was impossible.  But that did
not prevent me from fearing the effect of Frank's
influence over Fay, nor from feeling the pain of his
sudden disaffection towards myself.  We had got on
so well together at first&mdash;he and Fay and I; so well
that I had almost persuaded myself that at heart I
was as young as they were.  But now he had weighed
me in the balance of youth and had found me wanting:
and my soul shivered with dread lest Fay should do
the same.  I was used to having Tekel written over
my name: custom had gradually dulled the pain of
this superscription.  But the hurt, which had been
lulled by habit, awoke into full vigour when Frank's
boyish hand traced the usual word: and I felt that
when Fay wrote it too, my heart would break.
</p>

<p>
When Frank returned to Oxford and the Loxleys to
town, there followed a very quiet time at Restham
Manor.  I had looked forward to this quiet time as a
schoolboy looks forward to the holidays, thinking at
last I should have Fay to myself and could woo and
win her back to me.  But my hopes were doomed to
disappointment.  My darling seemed just as far from
me as ever, only instead of being gay and
laughter-loving she was quiet and depressed.
</p>

<p>
Annabel and I did all in our power to cheer her,
but in vain.  It was obvious that she was pining for
society of her own age, and feeling the reaction after
the gaiety of the Christmas vacation.
</p>

<p>
Then my sister came to the rescue with one of her
sensible suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Easter fell early that year; so early that Annabel
decided it was impossible to elude the East wind
altogether, and yet to be at home in time to prevent
Blathwayte from succumbing to the temptations of
Paschal ritual: therefore&mdash;since in her sisterly eyes
my chest was of more importance than Arthur's soul&mdash;she
suggested that she and Fay and I should go to
the South of France as soon as the East wind was
due, and remain there until after Easter.  By this
means (though this idea was understood rather than
expressed) not only should I be screened from the wind
that stirred the Vikings' blood, and Fay be spared
the dulness of a Restham Lent, but we should also
be away during Frank's next vacation, and so be beyond
the sphere of his influence for a longish period.
</p>

<p>
"Annabel has got such a splendid idea, darling," I
said to my wife as she was sitting listlessly in the
library one morning, glancing indifferently over the
newspapers whilst I smoked.
</p>

<p>
"Has she?"  Fay's irresponsive mood had become
almost chronic by this time.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to know what it is?" I continued,
valiantly trying to cure her depression by not
noticing it.
</p>

<p>
"Not particularly.  I'm not an inquisitive person,
you know."
</p>

<p>
This was decidedly crushing, but I persevered:
"But it concerns you, sweetheart."
</p>

<p>
"Does it?"
</p>

<p>
As Fay still did not ask what the idea was,
I thought I had better volunteer the information.
"She thinks you look a little pale and tired and
out-of-sorts, and that a change would do you good,"
I began.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite all right, thank you.  I don't require
any doing good at all&mdash;in fact, I'm not taking any at
present.  And as for being pale, the same Providence
that painted Annabel's cheeks pink painted mine
white, and so we must both stick to the colour ordained
for us."
</p>

<p>
It was uphill work, but I struggled on.  I wouldn't
for the world have let Fay see how much she was
hurting me: it would have pained her tender heart
to know she was giving pain; and as long as she
could be spared suffering, I was ready to take her
share as well as my own.  "But the spring is a
trying time of the year for everybody," I feebly
urged.
</p>

<p>
"I thought the spring in England was considered
such a top-hole sort of affair: one of the seven wonders
of the world.  The poets simply spread themselves
over it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, darling, so it is in a way: but I think when
the poets spread themselves they refer to the later
spring, and not to February and March.  Annabel
always trembles before the East wind then, as you
know."
</p>

<p>
"But nobody could accuse Annabel of being a poet."
</p>

<p>
This was undeniable, but it didn't help on the
conversation.  So I made a fresh start.  "She may not
be a poet, but she is a very sensible woman, and very
devoted to you, sweetheart; and she thinks that you
are looking listless and tired and in need of a change.
So she suggests that she and I should take you to
the South of France for Lent and Easter."  I was
determined to give my sister her full share of credit in
this matter; all the more so that I suffered some
compunction for my summary treatment of her at
Christmas.
</p>

<p>
Fay's pretty mouth began to pout.  "Not for
Easter, Reggie; I couldn't possibly go away for
Easter.  Frank and I and the Loxleys are getting up
a play here for Easter week, to be performed in the
village hall."
</p>

<p>
"I knew nothing of that.  You never told me
anything about it," I said in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I?  You don't care a bit about
theatricals, Reggie, or show the slightest interest in
them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  I am interested in anything that
interests my wife, as every good husband should be."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, don't talk flapdoodle to me!  It is
ridiculous to think you feel a thing simply because
you think you ought to feel it.  You assume that
because you ought to be interested in what interests
me, you are interested in it: but you really aren't in
the least.  I don't say that it wouldn't be nice if we
were both interested in the same things.  But if we
aren't, it doesn't make it any nicer to pretend that
we are."
</p>

<p>
I felt as if the solid earth were slipping away from
beneath my feet.  With the freedom of utterance
vouchsafed to the rising generation, Fay was shouting
upon the house-tops the things which Annabel only
whispered to me in my private sanctum, and which
I never breathed to a living soul.
</p>

<p>
"You and Annabel are always pretending that
things are quite different from what they are," Fay
went on; "and shutting your eyes to everything
you don't want to see.  Frank and I are fed up
with it."
</p>

<p>
At this I uttered a protest.  "No, no, Fay, you
and Frank are mistaken there.  Annabel is a most
straightforward person, and I am sure I try to be.
It isn't fair to say that we pretend."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't mean that you swank exactly: you
take in yourselves more than you take in anybody
else.  But, as Frank says, you cook up everything
and flavour it to taste, till there's nothing of the
original left.  It's much better to face facts as they
are, and try to make the best of them, than to invent
a heap of imaginary circumstances to fit in with your
own prejudices.  You and Annabel live in painted
scenery&mdash;not in a real landscape: but I'll do you the
justice to admit that you believe the painted slips are
real trees, and that the lake in the distance is real
water.  Frank says you do.  But when the time comes
for you to climb them and wash in it, you'll find your
mistake."
</p>

<p>
I was beginning to find it already, and I felt sick
with misery.  I had tried so hard to be a good husband
to my darling, and to make her as happy as she had
made me: but it seemed that I was foredoomed to
fail in that as in everything else.
</p>

<p>
By this time Fay had risen from her chair and was
standing with her back to the fire.  She looked more
like a daring and defiant boy than a dutiful and
devoted wife.  Her resemblance to Frank just then
was very marked; more so than I altogether liked,
for although even now I could not help being fond of
my brother-in-law, I by no means either admired or
approved of him.  I held out my arms to my wife, but
she eluded me with a boyish gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Reggie, don't begin to be spoony, for I'm
not in the mood for it.  You've got hold of a ridiculous
masculine notion that kisses make up to a woman for
anything: but they don't.  But because you think
they ought to, you imagine that they do; which is
you all over!  As Frank says, you take all your
thoughts and feelings, while they are in a liquid stage,
and pour them into moulds, like jellies and
blancmanges: and then your persuade yourself that they
grew of themselves into those stiff and artificial shapes.
And now you are trying to do the same with mine,
and I simply won't have it.  No mental and spiritual
jellies and blancmanges for me!"
</p>

<p>
I felt that I could not cope with Fay in this new
mood: she was beyond me: so I just let her have
her say.
</p>

<p>
"You and Annabel have concocted a scheme," she
went on, "that it is correct for a girl of nineteen to
enjoy foreign travel, and improving to her mind to see
strange countries: and that, therefore, the South of
France must be the one thing that I yearn for.  But
as a matter of fact, I don't yearn for it at all: it would
bore me to death, and I'm not going there.  Why
should I do things that I hate, because you and
Annabel have decided that I ought to enjoy them, and
therefore that I do?  In the same way Annabel has
decided that the East wind ought to give you a cold
on your chest, though as a matter of fact it never
does: but you don't dare to face it, for fear of
offending Annabel by not catching cold when she expected
you to."
</p>

<p>
I had believed that it was Annabel alone who was
fussy about the East wind, and that I was laughing
at her from my superior height: but now I learned my
mistake.
</p>

<p>
"What I do enjoy," continued my angry darling,
"is acting with Frank and the Loxleys: and I mean
to do it, too.  And if you and Annabel want to go
to your fusty old South of France for Easter, go: but
leave me at home with Frank, who will be back by
then."  And she tossed her curly head and dashed
out of the room.
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds I sat absolutely stunned by this
unexpected outburst: and then I stretched out my
arms on the table in front of me, and buried my head
in them, so as to shut out the sight and the sound of
everything: for I felt that my world was tumbling
down about my ears.
</p>

<p>
Bitterly hurt as I was, I could yet look at the matter
from Fay's point of view.  Annabel and I were dull
old fogies, and the life that I had offered to my darling
was not half full enough to satisfy her.  In spite of
all my struggles to adopt modern ideas, I was
evidently still wrapped in the toils of the Victorian
tradition that the warming of her husband's slippers
is an occupation noble enough to satisfy the aspirations
of any woman's soul.  In my heart I had smiled
at Annabel's antiquated ideas: but in Fay's young
eyes my ideas were as antiquated as Annabel's.
</p>

<p>
Yet I would have given everything&mdash;even life itself&mdash;to
make my darling happy: and therein lay the core
of the tragedy.  The good that I would do, I could
not: I was too old.
</p>

<p>
I had done my best, and I had failed.  What, then,
was there left to live for?
</p>

<p>
I was so swallowed up in this engulfing wave of sick
misery that I did not hear the door open or any one
enter the room.  But I was roused from the stupor of
despair into which I had fallen by feeling a pair of
soft arms clinging round my neck, and a soft cheek
pressed against my own; whilst the voice that made
the music of my life said in a trembling whisper:
"I'm so awfully sorry, Reggie, for being such a beast.
Do forgive me, and I'll never be such a brute again."
</p>

<p>
So I was raised by a touch from the Slough of
Despair to the Summit of the Delectable Mountains.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
A SORROWFUL SPRINGTIME
</h3>

<p>
It goes without saying that I forgave my darling,
for the good reason that I had nothing to forgive.
That part of the business was easy enough.  It also
goes without saying that Fay got her own way about
the proposed trip to the South of France: but that
part of the business was by no means easy.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was greatly surprised when I broke it to
her that Fay did not wish to go abroad.  But she was
more than surprised, she was indignant, when she
discovered that I intended to let my wife do as she
pleased in the matter.  If Fay did not want to go to
France, to France she should not go: that I said and
that I stuck to.
</p>

<p>
But the sticking was hard work.
</p>

<p>
I had always known that Annabel was obstinate:
but until that unhappy spring I had no idea how
colossally obstinate she could be.  Nothing that I said
had the slightest effect upon her.  She merely waited
until I had finished speaking, and then said her own
say over again, as if I had never spoken.  Fay was
quite right.  If Annabel thought that a person ought
to want a thing, she firmly believed that, therefore,
they did want it: and nothing that the person or that
any other person could urge to the contrary in any way
shook her in this belief.  I suppose I was like my sister
in this respect.  Fay said I was, and so I must have
been.  But I am sure that I made every effort to
struggle against this narrow-mindedness, and I am
equally sure that Annabel made no such effort at all.
On the contrary, she gloried in it.
</p>

<p>
"It is nonsense to say that young people don't
enjoy being taken abroad, Reggie," she declared over
and over again: "absolute nonsense.  It is only
natural that the young should enjoy variety of place
and scene."
</p>

<p>
"It may be natural, but it isn't true in this
particular instance," I vainly argued: "I have told you
till I'm sick of telling you that Fay doesn't want to
go abroad just now: and if she doesn't want to go,
she shan't go."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you are making a mistake, Reggie, and
that you will live to regret it."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt that I am.  As a matter of fact
I am always making mistakes and living to regret
them.  But that won't hinder me from making this
one mistake more."
</p>

<p>
"She would enjoy it when once she got there: I
know she would.  I used to love travelling on the
Continent when I was a girl."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you did, but that has nothing to do
with it.  You and Fay are absolutely different
people."
</p>

<p>
"Of course we are now, because I am so much older
than she is: but when we were the same age, I expect
Fay was very similar to me."  And then I had it all
over again about the normal desire of the young for
variety of place and scene.  I recognised the futility
of argument.  If Annabel believed that at any time
or at any age she and Fay bore the slightest resemblance
to one another, she could believe anything that
she wished to believe: and she did.
</p>

<p>
Although my sister never shook me for a moment
in my determination that Fay should have her own
way, she never for a moment ceased trying to shake
me; and I found it a most fatiguing process.  Of late
years we have heard much talk about "wars of attrition":
that is the kind of war in which Annabel would
have excelled.
</p>

<p>
There is a somewhat obscure passage in the Epistle
of St. Jude about the Archangel Michael contending
with the devil for the body of Moses.  I don't in the
least know what it means, but I know exactly what it
felt like: and it felt like something very unpleasant
indeed.
</p>

<p>
I suggested&mdash;and not altogether from unselfish
motives&mdash;that Annabel should repair to sunnier climes
alone: but she stoutly refused to leave me while the
East wind was in the air.  She seemed to think that
with her at my side I could defy my (so-called) enemy
more successfully than if I tackled him alone.  I
endeavoured to point out to her that, according to her
ideas, at any rate, my vulnerable part was not my
side&mdash;my heel of Achilles, so to speak, was situated in my
chest, and that, therefore, a silk muffler would be a
surer defence than a score of sisters.  But she still
held to her own opinion (as it was her nature to do)
that by some indefinable means her bodily presence
prevented the inclement breeze from visiting my chest
too roughly: and with the best intentions and the
worst results, she absolutely declined to go abroad
unless Fay and I accompanied her.
</p>

<p>
But the tiresomeness of Annabel at this time was
more than compensated for by the adorableness of
Fay.  Our little set-to in the smoking-room turned out
to be one of those blessed fallings-out that all the more
endear: and we had a heavenly time together,
unclouded by either the presence of Frank or the
persistence of Annabel.  At any rate, for the time being
we were all-in-all to each other.  Tennyson remarked
that "Sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering
happier things": but I must venture to disagree with
him, as I once ventured to disagree with Shakspere.
The memory of past happiness is a possession of which
Time and Circumstance are powerless to rob one: at
least I found it so in the dark days to come, when I
lived over and over again in memory those happy
weeks at Restham, after Fay and I quarrelled and
made it up again, and before Frank came back.
</p>

<p>
Then a fresh storm broke.  Annabel found out
about the play which was being prepared for Easter
week, and made herself extremely unpleasant over
it.  I did all in my power to smooth things over
between her and Fay, but with little success.  With all
my affection for my sister and all my adoration of my
wife, I cannot pretend that Fay was altogether easy
and adaptable when once her back was up; whilst
Annabel in such circumstances was absolutely
impossible.
</p>

<p>
Therefore at this particular time life passed but
roughly with me, as it did with the poet Cowper.  But
still rougher times were in store.
</p>

<p>
Frank's return complicated matters still further.
He came back to Restham having left the dons and
tutors of his college in a state of extreme dissatisfaction
with him, on account of the things he did and
the things he left undone.  Naturally he took Fay's
part&mdash;as indeed I did: but he made no effort to assist
me in my endeavour to placate Annabel as far as
possible without interfering with the theatrical
scheme.
</p>

<p>
I do not wish to pretend to miseries to which I have
no title: but I cannot help feeling that in this conflict
between the twins and Annabel, it was I who suffered
most.  Subsequent history has taught us that in a
war between two Powers the chief brunt falls upon
the neutral states.  Certainly it was so in my case.
As poor Belgium has long been the cock-pit of Europe,
so I became the cock-pit of Restham.  A most unenviable
position for either nations or individuals!
</p>

<p>
I was never alone for a minute with Annabel without
her beginning all over again about the pernicious
influence of amateur theatricals&mdash;as opposed to the
beneficent effect of foreign travel&mdash;upon the rising
generation: I was never alone for a minute with Frank
without his rubbing into me the various difficulties
which my sister raised with regard to the impending
performance in the village hall: and&mdash;which was worst
of all&mdash;I was never alone with Fay without knocking
my head and bruising my heart against an impalpable
barrier which had suddenly been raised up between
us; for the building of which barrier I blamed Frank.
</p>

<p>
"You are behaving very foolishly, Reggie, and you
will live to regret it," Annabel said, for about the
two hundredth time: "I can't understand why you
don't see the danger, as I see it."
</p>

<p>
I did see it: that was what made me so profoundly
wretched: but I did not see how it was to be averted
by any act of mine.
</p>

<p>
"I should simply put my foot down upon the whole
thing, if I were you," she nagged on.
</p>

<p>
"The putting down of one's foot is not such a simple
process as it used to be," I retorted: "or else my feet
are not of the putting down sort."
</p>

<p>
"Papa could always put his foot down fast enough
when he wanted to," argued Annabel.
</p>

<p>
"I know he could: but, as I have just told you,
I haven't inherited his particular make of feet."
</p>

<p>
Annabel went on as if I had not spoken.  "He
always put his foot down when I was Fay's age, if
I suggested doing anything that he didn't approve
of."
</p>

<p>
"But you were his daughter and Fay is my wife.
That makes all the difference."
</p>

<p>
"It didn't make any difference to him.  He put
his foot down just as much in dealing with poor
Mamma as in dealing with me."
</p>

<p>
"I know he did.  And she died of it."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked surprised at the bitterness of my
retort: but she would have looked more surprised
still if she had seen the greater bitterness of heart
which prompted it.  I was surprised myself at the
sudden rush of anger which flooded my soul at the
memory of how my gentle mother had gradually faded
away under the pressure of my father's kind, but
dominating, heel.  I had scarcely formulated it even
in thought&mdash;I had certainly never put it into words
before&mdash;but my subconscious mind must always have
rebelled against the knowledge that my mother had
really died of my father's strong will.  That was what
actually killed her, whatever the doctor's certificate
might say: and I had always known it, though I did
not know that I knew it until that moment.
</p>

<p>
It is strange how the dark subterranean rivers of
knowledge and memory, which flow fathoms below
the realm of conscious existence, now and again rise
to the surface, as if upheaved by some mighty volcanic
force of the spiritual world; and we suddenly know
that we have always known something of which until
that moment we had not the slightest idea.  And we
know more than this.  We see how that undreamed of
knowledge has moulded our minds and formed our
characters independently of our conscious selves, and
how in those dark, subterranean depths are laid the
foundations of the temples, which it is our life-work
to build and to make meet for the indwelling of the
Spirit of God.
</p>

<p>
Thus suddenly I understood that it was owing to a
great extent to my unconscious knowledge of my
father's well-meant tyranny towards my mother, that
I was what I was: a cowardly rebel, chafing under
Annabel's sway even while I submitted to it&mdash;a
weakly, indulgent husband, who would sooner relinquish
his lawful authority altogether than enforce it.
</p>

<p>
I recalled my wandering thoughts to find my sister
gazing at me in perplexity mingled with reproach.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Reggie, I don't know what you are coming
to!  I consider it shocking to speak of dear Papa in
that way.  I am sure he never controlled poor Mamma's
actions except for her own good."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly: and that was what killed her.  To be
constantly controlled for her own good, is enough to
crush the life out of any sensitive and high-spirited
woman."
</p>

<p>
"But Mamma wasn't at all high-spirited," Annabel
objected.
</p>

<p>
"Not when we knew her.  But I dare say she was
before Father began that foot exercise that you
consider so desirable.  Understand once for all, Annabel,
that no power on earth will ever induce me to treat
my wife as my father treated his."
</p>

<p>
Annabel looked still more shocked.  "Then I think
it is very undutiful of you; very undutiful indeed!
And especially after Papa earned a baronetcy for you,
and left you such an ample provision for keeping it
up.  And that reminds me what a pity it is that Fay
doesn't seem likely to have any children at present.
It would save all this dreadful theatrical fuss and
trouble if she had.  I always think a baby is such a
suitable diversion for a young married woman, besides
being so nice to have some one to carry on the title."
</p>

<p>
I felt that Annabel was becoming intolerable, so I
bolted out of the drawing-room, banging the door
behind me.  She had rather affected the drawing-room
of late in preference to the great hall, as Fay and
Frank usually occupied the latter.
</p>

<p>
Even now I can hardly bear to recall the happenings
of that most miserable springtime, so I will retail
them as briefly as possible.
</p>

<p>
The more Annabel opposed Fay's having her own
way, the more determined was I that Fay should
have it; although&mdash;to confess the truth&mdash;I disliked
that way, and feared its consequences, considerably
more than my sister did.  The memory of my dear
mother's submission upheld me.  I felt I had far
sooner Fay despised my weakness than died of my
wilfulness&mdash;even though that wilfulness were exercised
solely for what Annabel and my father would have
called "her own good."
</p>

<p>
The Loxleys came down like a wolf on the fold, and
the Manor was once again the scene of revelry by
night, and a noisy bear-garden by day.  I hated it all
inexpressibly; but I fought for it as I would have
fought for my life.  Ever since that horrible time I
have cherished the deepest pity for people who feel
bound by a real (or mistaken) sense of duty to do
battle for that which at the bottom of their hearts
they hate.  To them there is only one thing worse
than defeat&mdash;and that is victory.
</p>

<p>
Only once did I venture on a word of remonstrance
with my darling.
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart," I said one day, when she had rushed
into my library for some writing paper wherewith to
supply the epistolary needs of the Loxley family: "I
know how you are enjoying all this affair, and I
wouldn't for worlds interfere with your pleasure: but
don't you think that after this Play is over, you might
rest from theatricals for a time?"
</p>

<p>
The pretty scarlet mouth at once grew mutinous.
"Oh, Reggie, don't be a tiresome kill-joy!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm trying my best not to be," I answered
meekly: "I'm not killing this joy: I'm letting it live
out all its allotted days.  I'm only suggesting that it
shouldn't have a successor&mdash;at any rate, for the present."
</p>

<p>
Fay tossed her curly head and stamped her foot.  I
could read Frank's influence in every insubordinate
line of her.  "I think it is very horrid of you to be so
dreadfully bossy, and not to let Frank and me do as
we like!"
</p>

<p>
"But I do let you do as you like, my own.  I didn't
urge you to go abroad when you said you didn't want
to go; and I have never interfered with your theatrical
performances so far.  You can't say I have."
</p>

<p>
But she did say it.  "Yes, you have.  You have
looked as if you disapproved and have been terribly
wet-blankety at times, and Annabel has been simply
vile.  Frank has noticed it too."
</p>

<p>
"I am not Annabel, nor responsible for Annabel.
Heaven forbid!  I can't help my looks&mdash;nobody can,
or most people would&mdash;and if I look dull and what you
call wet-blankety, it isn't my fault but my misfortune.
And I really do try to see things from your point of
view, darling: I do indeed: but I can't help my
age&mdash;again, nobody can, or most people would."
</p>

<p>
Fay softened a little.  She even went the length of
sitting down on my knee as I sat by the fire, and
twisting her fingers in my front hair.  "You really aren't
so bad after all&mdash;considering everything," she
graciously admitted.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me, in my masculine folly, an auspicious
moment for presenting a petition to my sovereign.
"If I promise to be as nice as I know how for this
particular Play, and never so much as show a corner
of a wet blanket, won't you give up theatricals for a
bit, and turn your attention to other things?  It is
a pity to let anything absorb you to the exclusion of
everything else."  The memory of my late father's
foot still constrained me to supplicate where I knew
I had the right to command.
</p>

<p>
"But you like me to enjoy myself, Reggie?"
</p>

<p>
"More than I like anything in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Then why interfere at all in what gives me such
a ripping time?"
</p>

<p>
Then the devil entered into me under cover of my
own cowardice.  I couldn't bear Fay to think that it
was I who was inimical to her pleasure.  "Well, sweetheart,
it isn't I altogether: I adore you so that if I had
my own way I should give you everything that you
asked for, and let you do whatever you liked.  But
Annabel is a woman of the world, and old enough to
be your mother, and she sees that this continual
theatrical excitement is not altogether good for a young
girl.  It hurts me to refuse you anything far worse
than it hurts you: but while you are so young I
cannot indulge you and myself to the extent of
letting you do things that may work you lasting harm."
</p>

<p>
I had spoken to my own undoing.  Fay sprang to
her feet at once like an angry boy.  "So Annabel
disapproves of my acting, does she?  Then you can tell
her that I jolly well mean to go on with it!  As Frank
says, she and you together are choking the life and
spirit out of me, and making an old woman of me
before my time.  And I won't stand it&mdash;I won't!"
</p>

<p>
I struggled vainly to retrieve my position; but it was
too late.  "It isn't so much that Annabel disapproves,
darling," I lied valiantly, "but that she thinks so much
excitement is bad for you."
</p>

<p>
"What rot!" retorted Fay, looking more Frank-like
than ever: "I never heard such a lot of footling
flapdoodle as you and Annabel concoct when you set
fuzzling together&mdash;never in all my life!  I've simply
no use for you, Reggie, when you play the giddy old
maid like this!  I shall go and talk to Frank, who has
got more sense than you and Annabel put together!"  Wherewith
she bounced out of the room, and left me
lamenting over my egregious folly in having introduced
Annabel into the conversation at all, especially
as I did it with the unworthy motive of diverting Fay's
anger from myself.
</p>

<p>
All that Eastertide stands out in my memory as a
garish and lurid nightmare.  I cannot recall the details
of the Play, but I remember that it was considered a
great success, and that Fay and Frank fairly surpassed
themselves in the dance that they had prepared for the
occasion.  When it was over, Fay announced her
intention of returning with Frank and the Loxleys to town,
and staying a few days with the latter in order to
attend a few pieces which were running at the London
theatres.
</p>

<p>
I did not oppose her: I knew it would do no good.
She refused to listen to argument, and nothing would
induce me to put my foot down as my father had done
with such grim success before me.  But I looked
forward to her return from the Loxleys, when Frank
would have gone back to Oxford, and when the
summer and I would have my darling to ourselves, and
everything would come right again.  Annabel had
announced her intention of leaving Restham for a time
to visit the Macdonalds in Scotland: and I was sure
that when there was nobody to come between us, Fay
and I would once more be all in all to each other as
we had been before.
</p>

<p>
I did not trouble her with any explanations then:
I felt it was not the occasion for them: I saved them
all up for the happy time coming when I should have
my darling to myself.  And during the few days that
she was at the Loxleys' I was busy devising and
arranging little treats which I knew she would enjoy when
once Annabel's back was turned, and we two were
like a couple of children out of school.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth day after Fay's departure, I came down
to breakfast in better spirits than usual.  It was a
lovely April morning, and the spirit of the spring
seemed to have got into my blood and to send it
coursing through my veins more quickly than usual&mdash;that
spirit of hope which always promises more than it can
perform.  I felt sure that there was a good time
coming for Fay and me, after we had packed Annabel
safely off to Scotland, and that our slight falling-out
would again prove itself to be of that blessed sort
which all the more endears.
</p>

<p>
My cheerfulness was further increased by the sight
of a letter from Fay lying on the breakfast-table.  She
had only favoured me with hurried post-cards so far
since she left home; but this was a letter, and
her letters always gave me pleasure.  Moreover, I
felt this was going to be an extra pleasant one, as it
would doubtless herald her return home.  So I opened
it with all the joy of anticipation, and this is what I
read&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"My DEAR REGGIE,
</p>

<p>
"It is no good going on as we are doing: it is horrid
for you and horrid for me.  Annabel is quite right
in saying that we aren't at all suited to one another;
and I am sure that you will be much happier alone
with her, without Frank and me to bother you and
upset all your little fussy ways.  So we have decided to
leave England for good, and go back to live with Aunt
Gertrude: and we shall both go on the stage and earn
our living that way, though there is no necessity for
us to do so, as we have got some money of our own,
and Uncle Sherard and Aunt Gertrude have plenty
and will be only too pleased to have Frank and me
to live with them again.  But we shall still go on the
stage because we adore it so, and love acting and
dancing so much.  We always intended to do it, but
falling in love with you changed everything and
upset my plans.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't try to stop us, because you can't.
Frank arranged everything beforehand, and before you
get this letter we shall have sailed for Melbourne.  I
shan't write to you again, because the sooner you
forget me the better.  I hope you and Annabel will be
very happy together, just as you were before Frank
and I came to Restham.  And I am sure you will be,
as you have always loved her more than you have
loved me.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Good-bye.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From your loving wife,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"FAY."<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
DESOLATION
</h3>

<p>
I cannot remember what happened immediately
after Fay's letter shattered my life at one blow.  I
only know that Annabel found me lying unconscious
on the dining-room floor when she came down to
breakfast, and that I then had a severe attack of
brain-fever, which very nearly proved fatal.  But
Annabel and Arthur and Ponty were all very good to
me, and&mdash;with the aid of two trained nurses&mdash;brought
me back, sorely against my will, into that spoiled
life which I had hoped I had done with for ever.
</p>

<p>
As usual, I was foredoomed to failure.  I could not
even die when I wanted to.  In the words of the
unhappy Napoleonic Prince, called familiarly "Prince
Plon-Plon," I acknowledged my crowning defeat: "I
could succeed in nothing&mdash;not even in dying."
</p>

<p>
Fay's desertion had wounded me past healing.  It
was a catastrophe so unlooked for, so appalling, that
words were useless either to describe or to believe it.
The worst had happened.  I had been weighed in her
balance, been found wanting, and cast aside as
worthless: therefore there would be nothing worth living
for ever any more.
</p>

<p>
Yet I had to live.  That was the crowning wretchedness.
If I could only have hidden my misery in the
grave and have done with it&mdash;I, who was a mere
cumberer of the ground, and worse than a cumberer!
But I could not.  My hateful existence still dragged
on.  Even the fig-tree which bore no fruit was
commanded by Divine Mercy to wither away: but I was
not granted even this much grace: I was cursed to
live on, with Fay's <i>Tekel</i> branded on my brow.  It
was part of my punishment.  Like Cain, I learned
that there is a heavier penalty than death: and that
is life.  And, like him, I sometimes felt that my
punishment was greater than I could bear.
</p>

<p>
As my body grew stronger my spirit was gradually
roused from despondency to defiance.  What had I
done that such an unspeakable retribution should be
meted out to me?  I began to feel that my punishment
was not only greater than I could bear, but
greater than I deserved.  True, I had been weak and
tactless and over-indulgent: but was that enough to
merit a life-sentence?  For the first time in my life
I ceased to submit, but stood up like Job and
challenged the Lord to answer me out of the whirlwind,
even though before Him I was as dust and ashes.  But
I was not as dust and ashes before Fay and Frank;
yet they had treated me as if I were: and my heart
was hot within me as I mused upon their behaviour
towards me.
</p>

<p>
At first I had been utterly crushed and prostrate:
but as I regained my health I became angry and bitter.
All that had formerly been sweet in my nature
turned to gall, and I longed to curse God and die.
</p>

<p>
The hidden spirit of rebellion which I had unconsciously
cherished for forty-three years, and which I
had originally inherited from my mother, suddenly
sprang into life, thereby changing my whole nature.
I was no longer the weak and amiable dilettante
concealing a real tenderness of heart under an assumed
cloak of good-humoured cynicism: I was a fierce and
bitter Ishmael, driven out into the wilderness by
human treachery, and at war with God and man.
</p>

<p>
I hated Frank as vehemently as I still loved Fay.
But I could forgive neither of them.  My anger was
hot against them both.
</p>

<p>
I sternly refused to write to my wife, or to have
any direct dealings with her.  I instructed Arthur to
pay her an allowance of a thousand a year, in addition
to her own income, and to tell her from me that I
accepted her decision, and intended to abide by it.
</p>

<p>
"I will offer her the thousand per annum as you
wish it, old boy," said Blathwayte, "although I know
her aunt and uncle have heaps of money and nobody
to give it to but Fay and Frank: but I am certain
that in the circumstances Fay will refuse it."
</p>

<p>
I laughed bitterly: "Probably; but Frank and 'Aunt
Gertrude' won't, if I know anything about them: and
Fay will be over-persuaded by them."
</p>

<p>
And, as further events proved, I was right.
</p>

<p>
I am not justifying my conduct and feelings at this
ghastly time: I am only recording them, extenuating
nothing and setting down naught in malice.  I had
done once for all with what Fay called "flapdoodle"&mdash;that
bane of the generation to which Annabel and
I belonged.  Thenceforth I made up my mind to be
what I was, and not what an artificially trained
conscience thought that I ought to be.
</p>

<p>
The characters of the nineteenth century were rather
like the gardens of the eighteenth.  Their lines were
formal, their trees cut into unnatural shapes, and
their fruit carefully trained over stiff espaliers.  But
Fay and Frank taught me to deal with my character,
as Annabel had already learned to deal with her
garden: I swept away the formal beds, flung the iron
espaliers over the wall, and let the trees grow
according to their own will.  That the result, as far as I
was concerned, was not ornamental, I admit: and if
the former garden of my soul had been transformed
into a waste and horrible place where only thorns and
thistles and deadly nightshade grew, surely the
responsibility rested with my wife and her brother
rather than with me!  At least so it appeared to me
then.
</p>

<p>
In time I learned from Blathwayte that Fay and
Frank had arrived safely in Melbourne, and were
settled in the house of the Sherards, who were only too
delighted to have their niece and nephew with them
once more: and that my wife and her brother were
beginning at once to take up the stage as their
profession, Fay acting under her maiden name.
</p>

<p>
Although Annabel did not say "I told you so" in
so many words, the sentiment exuded from her every
pore.  And, truth to tell, she had told me so.  There
was no getting away from that fact.
</p>

<p>
She and Arthur were kind enough to me in their
respective ways, but I had no longer any use for
kindness.  There was nothing now that anybody could do
to relieve the utter blankness of my misery.
</p>

<p>
Though I was bitterly angry with Fay&mdash;though I
found it impossible to excuse or condone her cruel
behaviour towards me, her husband&mdash;I nevertheless
loved and longed for her with consuming and increasing
force.  "Let no man dream but that I loved her
still": therein lay the bitterest sting of my agony.  The
more I loved her the more impossible I found it to
forgive her: had I cared for her less, I might have
been less implacable.  That may not be a symptom of
ideal love, but anyway it was a symptom of mine.
</p>

<p>
But if I found it impossible to forgive Fay, I found
it still further out of my power to forgive Frank.
That Annabel had had her finger in the pie I could
not deny: she was by no means free from blame with
regard to what had happened: but the chief instigator
of the tragedy was Frank; of that I had no manner
of doubt whatever.  Without his baneful influence
Fay would never have dreamed of running away from
me: without his practical assistance, she never could
have accomplished it.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes wondered whether Annabel reproached
herself too severely for having, by her well-meant
interference, made such havoc of my life: had I spoiled
hers, as she had spoiled mine, I felt I should have
eaten my heart out with unavailing remorse.  But one
day this doubt was set for ever at rest by her saying
to me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Reggie dear, I am sometimes inclined
to blame myself for not having interfered with
Fay more than I did, and for letting her have so much
of her own way.  After all, she was young, and I knew
so much better about everything than she did."
</p>

<p>
After that remark, anxiety about Annabel's conscience
no longer troubled me.
</p>

<p>
She and Arthur were whole-heartedly on my side
in this hideous separation between my wife and me.
Naturally they did not say much to me in condemnation
of Fay: I could neither have permitted nor endured
it: but I knew they were feeling it in my presence
and expressing it in each other's; and they put
no curb upon their expressions of indignation against
Frank.
</p>

<p>
My old nurse, however, thought differently.  To
my surprise&mdash;though by this time I ought not to have
been surprised at any vagary of Ponty's&mdash;the person
she blamed in the whole affair was myself: and, what
is more, she did not hesitate to say so.  I felt that
she was unjust&mdash;cruelly unjust&mdash;and all the more so
that she had been so indulgent to me all through my
childhood: but what I thought of her had no effect
upon Ponty, any more than it had when I was a little
boy.
</p>

<p>
"You've yourself to thank for the whole terrible
business, Master Reggie," she said to me after my
restoration to what my friends and doctors described
as "health."  She was far too good a nurse to utter
unwelcome words into ears that she did not consider
strong enough to receive them.  To the needs of a
sick soul neither she, nor anybody else, paid any heed.
"I knew there'd be trouble as soon as you began
that 'Oranges and Lemons' nonsense of having Miss
Annabel and Mr. Frank to live with you; and I said
so, but you would have your own way, you having a
spice of obstinacy in your character as well as Miss
Annabel.  You weren't your poor Papa's son for
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I don't call doing what you think will make other
people happy exactly obstinacy, Ponty," I pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Call it what you like, Master Reggie, but that's
what it is.  Folks always find pretty pet names for
their own particular faults.  There was a man at
Poppenhall who prided himself upon what he called
his firmness, and impulsiveness, and economy: those
were the pet names he used: and yet all the village
knew that he was nothing but an obstinate, ill-tempered
old miser."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought I was doing right," I said.  It was
strange that Ponty was the only person against whom
I had no feeling of bitterness, and in whose presence
I felt less wretched than anywhere else.  This might
have been because she had been associated with peace
and comfort as long as I could remember: but I think
the real reason was that she was the only person who
blamed me and not Fay.
</p>

<p>
"And your Papa thought he was doing right when
he arranged your poor Mamma's whole time for her,
and never let her have a will or a way of her own.
She didn't run away: she hadn't the spirit for it, poor
thing!&mdash;and besides wives didn't run away in those
days as they do now.  But I saw what she didn't
think anybody saw; and I watched the life die out of
her like it does out of a fire that's got the sun on it."
</p>

<p>
I started.  So Ponty had consciously seen for herself
what had only been subconsciously revealed to me.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean that Sir John was unkind to her
ladyship: far from it: but he just crushed the life out
of her, like Miss Annabel does out of folks, without
knowing what he was up to.  They've always meant
well, both Miss Annabel and her Papa: but their
well-meaning has done more harm than other folk's
ill-meaning, in my humble judgment.  And when her
ladyship died, Sir John was as cut up as anybody
could wish to see, and never married again nor nothing
of that kind.  He called her ladyship's death a
dispensation of Providence, and bore it most beautiful;
and nobody knew but me as it was nothing but a
judgment on him for forcing poor Lady Jane into his
own mould, as you might say."
</p>

<p>
"But I never forced her ladyship into my mould,
heaven knows!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"No; but there was them as did.  And you let 'em,
and never interfered."
</p>

<p>
I felt I was a little boy again, being scolded by
Ponty in the sunny old nursery for some childish
misdemeanour.  It was a peaceful feeling and somehow
seemed to rest and soothe my weary and wounded
heart.
</p>

<p>
"But I did interfere," I said: "I always interfered
if I thought any one was interfering with her ladyship.
Surely no husband ever let his wife have more of her
own way than I did."
</p>

<p>
Ponty looked me up and down with scorn, as I
lolled on the chintz-covered window-seat.  "And
what good would your interfering do as long as Miss
Annabel was there, I should like to know?  Mark
my words, Master Reggie: the King of England
couldn't hold his own against Miss Annabel; let alone
a pretty young girl like her present ladyship.  I knew
what would happen as soon as you told me Miss
Annabel was going to stay on here after you married.
There's no throwing dust in my eyes!  I knew Miss
Annabel before you were born, and I knew her Papa
too; and I know what they're like when they're set
on moulding people.  I should pity the Pope of Rome
hisself if he was being moulded by Miss Annabel."
</p>

<p>
I agreed with her there.
</p>

<p>
"And if you ask me, Master Reggie" (I hadn't
asked her, but that was neither here nor there), "I
should say that the dreadful trouble was far more
Miss Annabel's fault than Mr. Wildacre's, though I
know some do say as it was all his doing: and I dare
say it was partly his doing too, as more than one can
play at 'Oranges and Lemons.'  But to put a young
girl under Miss Annabel's thumb, as you may say (for
when all's said and done her ladyship is only a young
girl), to my mind it was like throwing Daniel into the
den of lions; and unfortunately it didn't turn out so
well."
</p>

<p>
"I apparently was not successful in the role of the
angel who shut the lions' mouths," I said bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Not you, Master Reggie!  You haven't yet got
it in you to stand up against Miss Annabel, and never
had: any more than your poor Mamma had it in her
to stand up against Sir John.  Some folks can stand
up and some folks can't, and there's no blame either
ways, it happening just as you're made.  There was
a man at Poppenhall who married three times, and his
third wife was the only one of the three as ever stood
up to him.  And nine weeks to the day from his third
marriage he was laid to rest in Poppenhall Churchyard.
I remember it as if it was yesterday, and the
wreaths were something beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he couldn't stand being stood up to after
all those years," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No more than Sir John could have stood it, or
Miss Annabel.  Folks isn't used to it, if they've had
too much of the other thing: and that's where the
judgment comes in of letting them get like that.  It
stands to reason that the Almighty didn't send folks
into this world to be always having their own way at
the expense of other folks's: and they shouldn't be
given it.  What was sauce for you was sauce for Miss
Annabel, as I've told your poor Mamma over and over
again when you were both children.  But nobody but
her Papa could stand up to Miss Annabel even then;
and it isn't likely that they'll begin now."
</p>

<p>
I knew it was very weak of me to go on trying to
justify myself in Ponty's eyes; but I did it nevertheless.
"You see, I thought it would be too quiet for
her ladyship to be shut up to an old husband like me,
and that it would be more cheerful for her with Miss
Annabel and Mr. Wildacre here as well."
</p>

<p>
Ponty looked at me with a fresh influx of contempt:
"That's just what you would think, Master Reggie:
even as a little boy you were always one for taking
the wrong end of a stick.  You're not at all
old&mdash;quite a boy you seem to me; and old or not old,
nobody could deny that you're still a very handsome
gentleman.  And no woman ought to feel it dull to
live with her own husband, even if he were one of the
plain sort, and hadn't your good looks.  She's taken
him for better for worse, and for rougher for smoother,
according to the Marriage Service, and she ought to
abide by it."
</p>

<p>
"Always verify your quotations," I murmured, but
Ponty took no notice of my interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I don't hold with relations," she went
on, "in moderation, and at the proper time and place.
I remember when you and Miss Annabel were children,
her late ladyship gave me a fortnight's holiday after
a bad cold I'd had, and I went to stay with a
sister-in-law who was a widow, living some twenty miles
from Poppenhall.  It happened that my sister-in-law
died two days after I got there, which turned out most
fortunate for me, as such a lot of relations came to
the funeral, I can tell you I saw more of my own
family then than I'd seen for years, and I quite
enjoyed myself.  I always say there's nothing like
your own relations for a pick-me-up, as you might
say: but you don't want 'em hanging about all the
time, and telling you how to manage your own home
and husband."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a tap at the nursery
door, and Jeavons came in to say that old Parkins
had sent a message to know if I could come and ease
his pain as I had done before, it being specially severe
that morning.
</p>

<p>
I responded at once: and the request brought the
first ray of light that had shone on my life since Fay
left me.  It showed that I still had my uses, and was
not a mere cumberer of the ground.  Even if life was
over as far as I myself was concerned, I could still
help others by means of my healing power.  So I
entered the Parkins's cottage less miserable than I had
been for months.
</p>

<p>
I found the poor old man in great agony, and I
knelt down by the bed as was my custom, laying my
hand upon the painful part.  But for the first time
since I had received the gift, I found the heavens as
brass above me.  I was conscious of no Presence in
the room&mdash;of no vital force flowing through me.  My
prayers were dull and lifeless, and no virtue went
either in or out of me.
</p>

<p>
"It don't seem to answer this time, Sir Reginald,"
the old man groaned at last: "the pain do get worse
instead of better.  Oh dear, oh dear, what shall I do?
Nothing seems to do me any good, not even you!"
</p>

<p>
Sick at heart I tried again, but to no purpose.
There was no blinking the fact.  The power of healing
had gone from me.
</p>

<p>
Making what poor excuse I could, I stumbled out
of the cottage and into the open air: and then I found
my way into a little wood, and fell on my face, and
prayed that I might die.  It seemed as if God Himself
had forsaken me.
</p>

<p>
But gradually the knowledge came to me that it was
not so.  It was not that God had forsaken me, but
that I had forsaken God.
</p>

<p>
Scientists and materialists would doubtless explain
this loss of healing power by the fact that my sickness
and sorrow had so lowered my vital force that there
was no strength left in me, and that I could not pass
on to another what I no longer possessed myself.  But
I did not trouble my head with such soothing and
soporific sophistries.  To me, they were utterly beside
the mark.  Once again I adopted the simpler course
of accepting literally the words of Christ: "If ye
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive you your trespasses."  That was what
He said, and that was what I believe He meant.
</p>

<p>
I had not forgiven&mdash;I could not forgive&mdash;Fay and
Frank for the evil that they had done me: therefore
I was no longer a fit channel for Divine Grace.
</p>

<p>
To my mind the thing was as clear as daylight, and
needed no (so-called) scientific explanation.
</p>

<p>
But that did not make it any easier to forgive them:
on the contrary.  If I had found it too hard to forgive
Frank for coming between me and my wife, I found
it a hundred times harder to forgive him for coming
between me and my God.  I hated him for having
spoilt this life: but I hated him still more for having
spoilt the life to come.  It was bad enough of him to
have turned me out of my earthly Paradise: but it was
infinitely worse to have shut me out of Heaven as well!
</p>

<p>
And as I lay on my face writhing in spiritual agony,
from the depths of my soul I cursed Frank Wildacre.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
THE NEW DEAN
</h3>

<p>
The days grew into weeks, and the weeks into
months, but nothing occurred to lessen my misery.
As I look back upon that hideous time, I can recall
nothing but one long dreary stretch of unalloyed
wretchedness.  I resumed my usual round of duties,
domestic and parochial; but nothing either in my own
estate or in the surrounding neighbourhood afforded
me the slightest interest.  And for all this, I had to
thank Frank Wildacre.  This thought was always
more or less with me.
</p>

<p>
But about a year and a half after Fay left me, a
most unexpected thing happened.
</p>

<p>
Annabel came into the library one morning obviously
bursting with news.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, what do you think?  I have just been
to the Rectory to see Mr. Blathwayte about some
parish matters, and he has told me a most exciting
piece of news, and has asked me to come and tell you,
because he is too busy to do so this morning, but he
will come to tea this afternoon and consult you
about it."
</p>

<p>
My heart began to beat furiously.  Surely any
exciting news that Arthur received must be in some
way connected with Fay.  I never wrote to her, nor
she to me: I was too proud to do anything but submit
to her decision on that point.  I was also too proud
to ask Arthur direct questions about her: but with a
delicate tact, for which beforehand I should never
have given him credit, he gave me apparently casual
information about her from time to time.  I was as
bitterly angry with her as ever; I was as far from
forgiving her as ever: but I could not forget that she
was my wife, and I still loved her as I loved my own
soul.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?" I asked, stifling the trembling
of my voice as best I could.
</p>

<p>
"Guess," said Annabel.  "It's really the most
wonderful thing!"
</p>

<p>
I was amazed&mdash;as, indeed, I often was in those
days&mdash;at my sister's unabated appetite for the trivial.
After such an unprecedented cataclysm as Fay's
departure, the day of small things had gone by as I
thought for ever: and yet, though it had completely
overturned my world, it had left Annabel pretty much
as it found her.  It is at times such as this that the
unutterable loneliness of the human soul becomes
almost overwhelming, and one realises that the heart
knoweth its own bitterness, and a stranger&mdash;nay, not
only a stranger, but also one's nearest and
dearest&mdash;cannot intermeddle with its joy.  True, there was no
longer any joy in my heart for anybody to intermeddle
with: but in its bitterness it stood utterly alone.
</p>

<p>
To me Fay, in spite of my anger against her, was
still sacrosanct.  Though fallen from her original
estate, she was yet, in my eyes, an angel.  But to
Annabel she was nothing but a naughty child that
needed punishment; and my sister troubled herself
about her no more than she would about a naughty
child.  Therefore I could not make trivial and absurd
guesses about anything concerning Fay.
</p>

<p>
"I can't guess," I said rather shortly: "please tell me."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Blathwayte has been offered the Deanery of
Lowchester."
</p>

<p>
My heart sank down into my boots again.  What
were Deaneries or even Archbishoprics compared with
Fay?  Then I blamed myself for my selfishness, and
tried to atone for it.  "What a splendid thing for
old Arthur!" I said: "I am awfully glad.  Tell me
all he said."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Annabel proceeded to obey me more or
less implicitly, interspersing Arthur's quoted remarks
with innumerable commentaries of her own.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a splendid thing for him," she said in
conclusion, "as he is really a most able and gifted
man, and such a capital organiser, and there is no
proper scope for him in a small village like this.  I've
liked to have him here, but I have always felt he was
a bit buried."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember Mrs. Figshaw?" said I, "who
kept saying that her daughter wanted a <i>scoop</i>?  I
agree with you that Blathwayte is like Mrs. Figshaw's
daughter: he wants a scoop badly."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Scope</i>, Reggie; not <i>scoop</i>," corrected Annabel.  I
should have been disappointed in her if she had not
done so.  At least I should have been disappointed a
year ago: but even Annabel had ceased to amuse me
now.
</p>

<p>
"We shall miss Blathwayte," I remarked: "at least
you will."
</p>

<p>
"But why me particularly?  Surely the Rector is
more your friend than mine."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  But I have lost the power of missing
any person save one.  In my case all lesser griefs
have been swallowed up in the one great one."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Reggie!  But it's a pity to feel like that,
and all the same I feel sure you'll miss Mr. Blathwayte
more than you think you will when the time comes.
And I shall miss him too, as he has always been so
good in being guided by me, and has followed my
advice in everything connected with the parish."
</p>

<p>
I doubted this, though I should have considered it
most unfair to Arthur to say so: but there was a
quiet obstinacy about him which might raise him at
times even to the height of standing up against
Annabel.  Fortunately, however, she had never found
it out and I should have been the last to enlighten her.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she continued, "cathedrals and daily
services and things like that are apt to lure men into
ritualism: I only hope Mr. Blathwayte will have the
strength of mind to resist them: and you must be very
careful, Reggie, in selecting a new rector not to get
any one with leanings that way.  I could never allow
anything ritualistic in our Church."
</p>

<p>
I wondered she didn't say "my Church," and have
done with it: but I hadn't the heart to chaff her as
I used to do in those happy bygone days, ages ago,
before ever the Wildacres came to Restham: so I let
it pass.
</p>

<p>
"I expect I shall put the matter into the Bishop's
hands," I said: "I don't feel competent to select a
spiritual pastor for Restham or anywhere else."
</p>

<p>
"You selected Mr. Blathwayte, and he has been a
great success.  It is a pity to get into the habit of
thinking you can't do anything, Reggie, because you
really do some things extremely well."
</p>

<p>
"But not the things I care about," I added bitterly,
"And in this case I haven't another Arthur up my
sleeve."
</p>

<p>
"The Bishop may have one," suggested Annabel
encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"Probably.  He certainly has more room up his
sleeve than I have.  I wonder if that was the origin
of Bishops having such large sleeves&mdash;because they
had always got something up them."
</p>

<p>
Annabel was as literal as ever.  "I don't think so,
Reggie; I really don't know the origin of Bishops
having those full sleeves.  I know when it was the
fashion for ladies to have large sleeves they were called
'Bishops' sleeves' after the Bishops; but why the
Bishops originally had them I haven't a notion.  I
must try to find out.  It is so interesting and instructive
to learn the reason and the origin of things like
that.  But Deans don't have large sleeves, do they?"
she added, her wandering thoughts turning once more
Arthurwards.
</p>

<p>
"No; but they have beautiful arrangements about
the legs&mdash;aprons and breeches and gaiters, and
goodness knows what!  They are Bishops below the waist
and men above it, like the Centaurs, don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"But the Centaurs were half horses&mdash;not half
Bishops, Reggie."
</p>

<p>
"I know: but the principle is the same."
</p>

<p>
"And not big sleeves, you are sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  Deans do not burn the candles at both
ends, so to speak, as Bishops do: they are content to
take care of the legs, and leave the arms to take care
of themselves."
</p>

<p>
Annabel smiled the tolerant smile of elder-sisterhood.
"How funny you are, Reggie!  It is nice to
hear you making jokes again."
</p>

<p>
And she went out of the room happy in the conviction
that I was what she would have called, "getting
over it."
</p>

<p>
Arthur came over to the Manor in the afternoon,
and confirmed what Annabel had said.  He had
indeed been offered the Deanery of Lowchester: but
had not yet decided, as Annabel had, that he should
accept it.  I was amazed at his hesitancy, considering
what a splendid offer it was for a man still comparatively
young, and also&mdash;as Annabel had pointed out&mdash;what
a grand scope it would give him for his hitherto
wasted powers of organisation: but slowly the reason
for this hesitancy dawned upon me.
</p>

<p>
"To put it in plain English, old man," I said, after
we had discussed the question in all its bearings, and
light was beginning to penetrate the mists of my
confusion, "the only reason you really have against
accepting this offer is <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
Arthur blushed: a rare indulgence with him.
"Well, I don't know that I should put it as bluntly
as that, Reggie&mdash;&mdash;" he began in his deliberate way.
</p>

<p>
I interrupted him.  "But <i>I</i> should.  It is always
best to put things in the bluntest way possible, and
to look at them as they really are.  I learnt that from
Fay.  She taught me to have a horror of everything
that she designated by the inclusive term 'flapdoodle.'"
</p>

<p>
I made a point of bringing my wife's name into a
conversation now and again: it seemed somehow to
narrow the gulf between us.  Nobody, except Ponty,
ever voluntarily mentioned Fay's name to me (and
perhaps that was the reason why I still found a certain
amount of comfort in Ponty's society, and why I
allowed my old nurse to take such egregious liberties
with me): so that unless I spoke sometimes of my
lost darling, she would have been altogether put away
out of remembrance.
</p>

<p>
In the same way I have always hated the custom
which obtains amongst many people, of never speaking
at all of those who have "crossed the flood," or
else of speaking of them in an entirely unnatural tone
of voice, and making use of such prefixes as "dear"
or "poor."  Such a custom, to my mind, gives the
indirect lie to all Christian teaching as to the
resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come,
and is only fit for those who sorrow without hope.
I maintain that those whom we falsely call our dead
should be spoken of as naturally and as frequently as
those whom we&mdash;making a distinction without a
difference&mdash;choose to call our living.  It always irritates
me when Annabel says "dear Papa" and "poor
Mamma": she would never have dreamed of using
either adjective in the days when our parents were
still with us at Restham: and to do it now creates a
sort of artificial atmosphere about them, which I, for
one, resent.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say it is awfully vain and presumptuous on
my part," Arthur continued, "to think that my
coming or going would make much difference to you: but
if I was any comfort to you at all, I should hate to
take it away from you just when you have had and are
having such a rough time."
</p>

<p>
I was touched by Arthur's unselfishness: and also
remorseful at the realisation of what little difference
his or anybody else's coming or going made to me now.
</p>

<p>
I put my hand on his arm, as we sat smoking by
the library fire.  "You mustn't get that notion into
your head, old man: it would make me ever so much
more miserable than I am at present if I felt I had
in any way hindered your career.  It is always bad
policy to throw good money after bad; and I am bad
money and you are good, as far as economic currency
is concerned.  Don't think me ungrateful for all you
have done for me, because I am not."
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish!" growled Arthur.  "I've done nothing
for you at all."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you have: you've been as true a friend to
me as man ever had.  You've done a lot for me
during the beastly time I've gone through."
</p>

<p>
"Then let me stay on here, and go on doing a lot
for you.  I ask for nothing better."
</p>

<p>
Then I felt it was time to be brutal and to speak
the unvarnished truth.  "You've done all you can for
me, old man: I hate to say it, but it's the truth.  If
you stayed on here, you won't do me any more good,
and you'd have spoilt your career for nothing.  You
did help me at first, I admit, and I shall be always
grateful for it.  But to be perfectly candid with
you&mdash;though I hate candour, mind you, and would never
employ such a painful weapon unless I felt it to be
absolutely necessary&mdash;neither you nor anybody else
can help me now."
</p>

<p>
"Except Fay," suggested Arthur, hardly above a
whisper, as if he were referring to some one who had
been buried for years.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "I doubt if even she could help
me now.  Even if she came back&mdash;which she never
will&mdash;things could never be the same between us as
they used to be.  I haven't forgiven her&mdash;I cannot
forgive her&mdash;and I couldn't live with her and be at
enmity with her at the same time.  Life would be
unendurable in such circumstances."
</p>

<p>
Arthur smoked in silence for some minutes: then
he said: "Is that why you have never come to Holy
Communion now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I cannot say that I am in love and charity
with my neighbours as long as I haven't forgiven Fay
and Frank.  But I haven't; and I don't feel as if I
ever could; and I cannot take the Blessed Sacrament
until I do.  That is another thing I owe to Frank,"
I added bitterly; "he has cut me off from the means
of grace as well as from the hope of glory.  For the
more I think of it the more I am convinced that it was
entirely his doing that Fay left me."
</p>

<p>
Again Arthur smoked for some time in silence, and
then he said: "I think you are right, Reggie: you are
beyond my help altogether, and if I stayed on here I
shouldn't do you any good."
</p>

<p>
"I am past all human help," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think you are," said Arthur in his slow
way; "but human help doesn't count for much after
all.  There's plenty of the Other Sort left&mdash;more than
you or anybody else can ever need."
</p>

<p>
"Not for me: I have forfeited my claim to it," I
groaned in the anguish of my heart, as I remembered
how I had cried in vain by old Parkins's sick bed for
the Help That never came.
</p>

<p>
Arthur did not speak, but he smiled the smile that
I used to see on my mother's face when I was a little
boy, and on Fay's in the days when I was pretending
that I didn't love her&mdash;a smile which said as plainly
as if it had been put into words: "You don't know
what you are talking about," but said it with a
tenderness that it was beyond the power of any words
to express.
</p>

<p>
I think the ruler of the synagogue must have seen
that same Smile&mdash;intensified a thousandfold&mdash;when
his servants met him and said: "Thy daughter is
dead: why trouble thou the Master any further": and
the Answer came: "Be not afraid: only believe."

CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
A SURPRISE
</h3>

<p>
So Arthur Blathwayte was made Dean of Lowchester,
and at once began his preparations for vacating
Restham Rectory; while his promotion gradually
subsided from a nine days' wonder into an ordinary
and commonplace event.
</p>

<p>
But there was still a greater surprise in store for
me and for Restham.
</p>

<p>
Annabel came into the library one morning with
the ominous words: "I've got something to say to
you, Reggie."
</p>

<p>
I looked up from the letter I was writing, and
wondered indifferently what fresh vexation was in
store.  Nothing had any longer the power to vex me
very much: but I could guess from Annabel's expression
that something was coming which would vex me
as much as it was able.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Annabel remained standing opposite to me on the
other side of the writing-table.
</p>

<p>
"I expect it will surprise you a good deal, Reggie."
</p>

<p>
"Well, out with it.  Has Blathwayte been offered
another Deanery, or has the cook given notice?  And
don't you think you'd better sit down?"
</p>

<p>
Annabel sat down on the most uncomfortable chair
within reach.  "Mr. Blathwayte has asked me to
marry him, and I've accepted," she blurted out.
</p>

<p>
She was right.  It did surprise me more than I had
thought I could ever be surprised again.  It fairly
took my breath away.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens, Annabel!" I gasped, when my
breath returned to me.  "This is astounding news
indeed."
</p>

<p>
The murder being out, Annabel was herself again,
and went on explaining with her accustomed
volubility: "I was surprised myself, Reggie, when Arthur
(I shall call him Arthur now) proposed to me, as I had
given up the idea of marrying years ago.  Just at
first the notion seemed to me ridiculous.  But after
I'd thought it over for a bit, I saw how necessary it
was for anybody as important as a Dean to have a
wife at his elbow to tell him what to do, and what
not to do.  It didn't matter while he was only Rector
of a small village like this, though even here he rarely
acted without my advice: but I don't see how he
could possibly manage to be Dean of Lowchester all
by himself, do you?"
</p>

<p>
I admitted the difficulties of undertaking such a
situation single-handed, and my sister continued:
"Although I have the greatest respect&mdash;I think I may
say the deepest affection&mdash;for Mr. Bl&mdash;&mdash;Arthur (I
find it a little difficult to remember to say Arthur
at present, but I shall soon get into the way), I cannot
blind my eyes to the fact that he is inclined to have
ritualistic tendencies, and a cathedral, I consider, is
just the place to encourage that sort of thing, what
with the anthems and daily services, and goodness
knows what!  So different from the quiet routine of
a mere parish church.  But, you see, if I was there,
he couldn't give himself over altogether to ritualism."
</p>

<p>
I did see that&mdash;clearly&mdash;in spite of my dazed condition.
</p>

<p>
"I should be dreadfully vexed," Annabel went on,
as I was still more or less speechless with amazement,
"if after having got such a splendid appointment,
Mr. Blathwayte, I mean Arthur, spoilt it all by
ritualism or any folly of that kind.  It would be such
a dreadful pity!  I have often noticed that people
wait for a thing for years, and then when they get
it at last, they do something that makes you wish
they had never had it at all.  And I should blame
myself if Arthur did anything of that kind."
</p>

<p>
I winced.  I had waited for forty-three years for
the happiness that comes to most men in their
twenties, and then somebody had done something that
made me wish I had never had it at all: but I was as
yet far from seeing that that somebody was myself.
</p>

<p>
"And then, of course," continued Annabel, with a
change in her voice, "there is you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is me," I replied grimly.  I wondered
how Annabel was going to explain me away.
</p>

<p>
"At first I felt I really couldn't leave you&mdash;especially
now you are quite alone; and that I must refuse
Mr. Blath&mdash;Arthur, in consequence.  But on thinking
the matter over and looking at it sensibly, I
remembered that a man must leave his father and mother
and cleave to his wife, which of course includes a
woman and her brother.  And, when all's said and
done, you married, so why shouldn't I?"
</p>

<p>
By this time I had recovered my speech, and also
my better feelings.  At the first shock the idea of
Annabel's marriage was revolting to me: I do not
attempt to deny it: and the thought of her leaving
me seemed Fate's final blow.  But as I pulled myself
together I realised that the selfishness of sorrow was
swallowing me up, and I determined to escape from
it before it was too late.
</p>

<p>
Much is said on behalf of the sweetening uses of
adversity; but, for my part, when people talk about
the discipline of suffering, I always want to substitute
the word "temptation" for "discipline," as I know
few greater temptations to selfishness than bodily
sickness and mental anguish.  I cannot believe that
either sickness or sorrow in itself makes men better:
but if men grow better in spite of sickness and sorrow,
then they are conquerors indeed.  When we are told
that the Captain of our Salvation was made "perfect
through suffering," I do not think it is a proof of the
beauty of suffering, but of the Divinity of Christ.
Even that crowning temptation was powerless to hurt
Him.  And if He could be perfect in spite of the
things He suffered, so can we, provided that we abide
in Him and He in us.
</p>

<p>
But I was not abiding in Him just then.  I had
gone out into the far country, because the one restriction
of the Father's House was too hard for me: that
restriction which I had persistently set aside: "If ye
forgive not men their trespasses neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses."
</p>

<p>
Still there was enough Grace left in me to enable
me to struggle, however vainly, against the wave of
selfishness which was overwhelming my tortured soul,
and I struggled.  "You are quite right, Annabel, in
saying and thinking that you have as much right to
marry as I had; and it would be abominable selfishness
on my part to say a word to dissuade you from
any course which tended to your happiness."
</p>

<p>
Here Annabel's sense of justice interrupted me.
"Still, Reggie, I did say no end of words to try to
dissuade you: there's no shutting your eyes to that
fact; and therefore you have a perfect right to say
anything you like to dissuade me.  But I think I can
honestly say that when I tried to prevent you from
marrying Fay, I was thinking of your happiness rather
than of my own."
</p>

<p>
"I'd take my oath on that," I said warmly.
</p>

<p>
"And of course I'd no idea that things would turn
out as they have," Annabel continued, "or else I
should have tried to dissuade you much more strongly
than I did.  It would have been my duty to do so.
Just as it would be your duty to do anything you could
to prevent me from marrying Mr. Blath&mdash;Arthur, if
you thought there was any probability of his running
off to Australia and going on to the stage."
</p>

<p>
I was again able to take my oath that I apprehended
no such dangers.  "But do you love him?" I added.
"That is the main thing."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should hardly like to apply such a term
as 'love' to the feelings of a woman of my age, but I
must admit that I am sincerely attached to Arthur,
and have the greatest respect for his character.  And
I must also admit that the lot he asks me to share
presents the greatest attractions to me.  I don't wish
to appear conceited, but I do think that I am rather
wasted on a small place like this, just as Arthur is.
I mean there is more work in me than Restham
requires."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that, like Mrs. Figshaw's daughter, you
also want a 'scoop'?"
</p>

<p>
"A <i>scope</i>, Reggie: that is what I do mean.  I love
arranging things, and I've arranged and planned and
organised here till there's nothing left to plan or
arrange or organise.  And we shan't be far off&mdash;only
about an hour's ride in the car; so that you can always
come over and consult me about anything, and I can
come over here constantly and keep my eye on your
servants.  I really don't see that with me within an
hour's motor-ride they can go very far wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I.  Moreover, Ponty's eye is almost as
all-seeing as yours."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," added Annabel thoughtfully, "Mr. Blathwayte,
I mean Arthur, is five years younger than
I am: but if he doesn't mind that, I don't see why
you should."
</p>

<p>
"I don't," I hastened to assure her: "that is
nobody's business but his and yours.  And the
experience of life has taught me that there are distinct
disadvantages to a woman in having a husband older
than herself.  But, Annabel," I added, getting up
from my seat and going across to where she sat and
laying my hand on her shoulder, "although I am
naturally surprised at what you have told me, and
am very sorry to lose you, I am very glad as well:
for I am sure it would be impossible for any woman
to have a better husband than old Arthur.  I hope you
will be very happy, and, what is more, I am sure you
will."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Reggie: and as for leaving you I feel
I can do it more easily now than I could before you
were married.  I'm nothing like so necessary to you
now as I was then."
</p>

<p>
I hastened to disclaim this accusation; but
underneath my disclaimer I was haunted by a lurking
consciousness that Annabel's common sense had, as
usual, hit the mark.  She was not as necessary to my
happiness as she had been before my marriage: nobody
was, except Fay, and I feared that she was lost
to me for ever.
</p>

<p>
I cannot deny that Annabel's engagement was a
tremendous surprise to me: but as I became accustomed
to the surprise, I was shocked to find hidden
beneath it an unholy little mixture of relief.  I hated
myself for the knowledge, and violently battled against
it, but all the same I could not help knowing that
Restham Manor without Annabel would be a much
more easy and restful abode than it had ever been
before.  And at the very back of my mind&mdash;so far
back that I was scarcely conscious of it&mdash;there sprang
up a tiny and indefinite hope that&mdash;with Annabel
gone&mdash;Fay might come back to me once more.  But not
with Frank: even though it might be possible for me
sometime to forgive my wife, it could never be possible
for me to forgive her brother: of that I felt certain:
He had injured me far too deeply.  But though the
possibility of Fay's return crept into the realm of
practical politics, I was too proud to ask her to come
back to me.  She had left me of her own free will,
and she should come back to me of her own free will
or not at all.  And this was not entirely selfish pride
on my part, though doubtless to a great extent it was.
Much as I loved my wife, much as I longed for her, I
did not wish her to return until she felt she could
be happy with me.  Once again&mdash;as before I proposed
to her&mdash;I was not willing to purchase my own happiness
at the cost of Fay's.
</p>

<p>
Of course the marriage of Annabel to Blathwayte
was a nine days' wonder in Restham&mdash;a wonder which
I shared with my humbler neighbours.  However
devoted to his sisters a man may be, the fact that
other men want to marry them never fails to appeal
to his sense of humour: and the appeal is by no means
minimised if the sister happens to have attained to her
fiftieth year.  In spite of all the sorrow through which
I had passed and was still passing, I was still
sufficiently a boy at heart to laugh at the idea of good
old Arthur's marrying Annabel.
</p>

<p>
I did not&mdash;I could not&mdash;believe that the attachment
dated from Blathwayte's youthful days, since the
difference between twenty-five and thirty is much
greater than that between forty-four and forty-nine.
My explanation of the phenomenon was that he was
suddenly faced with the prospect of doing without
Annabel, and found he couldn't stand it; and
so&mdash;necessity being the mother of invention&mdash;it occurred
to him to marry her instead.  I think she had become
as much an integral part of his scheme of things as
the sun or the moon or the General Post Office; and
although one might not spontaneously think of marrying
the sun or the moon or the General Post Office, it
is conceivable that one might even go to that length
rather than do without them altogether.
</p>

<p>
But so inconsistent is human nature, although my
higher self struggled against any selfish desire to keep
Annabel at Restham, and my lower self was secretly
relieved at the prospect of her departure, I was
nevertheless hurt that she should wish to leave me.  Once
again I was brought face to face with the old problem,
how is it that the people always behave so much better
to other people than other people ever behave to
them?  To which I believe the real answer is that we
all expect so much more of each other than we are
prepared to give in return.
</p>

<p>
My unholy relief at the transference of Annabel's
beneficent yoke from my shoulders to Arthur's was
shared to the fullest extent by Ponty, and in her case
it assumed no secret or surreptitious form.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be a good thing for Miss Annabel to have a
house and a husband of her own at last," she
remarked, "to order about as she pleases; and leave
you and me to do what we like at the Manor, Master
Reggie."
</p>

<p>
"But you seem to forget that she is taking a vow
of obedience to her husband," I suggested, "which
she certainly never took with regard to you and me."
</p>

<p>
Ponty shook her old head.  "Vows or no vows,
Miss Annabel will always wear the breeches."
</p>

<p>
"Which in this case happens to be gaiters as well,"
I added: "but I've no doubt that she will wear them
all, with the apron thrown in."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't so much mind Miss Annabel having
everything her own way at the Deanery, Master Reggie,
because when all's said and done it's the course of
nature for a woman to rule her own husband; but no
woman was ever intended to rule her brother, and
particularly her brother's wife, and it's against nature
that she should.  And what's against nature always
ends in trouble sooner or later, mark my words!
There was a man at Poppenhall when I was a girl who
suddenly took it into his head to leave off eating meat,
and lived instead upon nuts.  He said there was a lot
of nourishment in a nut, which it stands to reason
there couldn't be, it all being made of what you might
call wood, and indigestible at that.  But anyway, he
hadn't lived on nuts for more than a year when he,
fell off a rick he was thatching and broke his neck.
Which was nothing but a judgment upon him for going
against nature.  And for months before he died, you
could hear the nuts rattling inside him, like a baby's
rattle."
</p>

<p>
"A terrible fate!" I said gravely.  "But I may
add for your comfort that if it is natural, as you say,
for every woman to rule her own husband, there is no
fear of Miss Annabel's going against nature: and I
am sure that the Dean will make her an excellent
husband."
</p>

<p>
"None better: he's one in a thousand is Mr. Blathwayte,
and always has been.  And Miss Annabel won't
make a bad wife either, for them as like those
masterful, managing sort of wives.  She'll always have her
house kept beautiful; and she'll be Dean of Lowchester
and Chapter too, if they don't take care."
</p>

<p>
"But she'll be a very good Dean and Chapter, Ponty."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Master Reggie, you have the right of it there.
Whatever Miss Annabel sets herself to do, she'll do
well: no manner of doubt on that point.  She's always
from a child been one to do her duty: I will say that
for her.  It's only when she sets about doing other
people's duty that she begins to get troublesome."
</p>

<p>
"The Dean and Chapter may possibly find it
troublesome when she begins to do their duty," I
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That's their business and not mine, Master Reggie.
Miss Annabel has been my business for close on fifty
years, and I'm glad to hand her on to somebody else.
Not that I'm not fond of her, for I am, and have been
ever since I took her on from the monthly nurse
forty-nine years ago: but she was a handful from a baby,
though always a fine child, with a skin as fair as a
lily, and hair that curled quite easy and kept in curl,
though I can't pretend as it ever curled natural,
because it didn't.  But I'd no trouble in curling it as
some folks have.  I remember a woman at Poppenhall,
whose children's hair was as straight as never was,
though she put it in curling-papers every night of their
lives, feeling she didn't like to be bested by her own
children's hair, as you might say.  But instead of
taking the curl any better, it all came off, the
curling-papers having stopped the natural growth; and those
children's heads were as bare as billiard-balls.  I
suppose it was a judgment on her for going against
nature."
</p>

<p>
"But you went against nature in curling Miss Annabel's
hair, and yet no judgment seems to have fallen
upon you," said I, as I thought pertinently.
</p>

<p>
"That was quite different, Master Reggie."  Like
the rest of her kind, Ponty recognised the incalculable
difference between her own case and the case of
everybody else.  "Although Miss Annabel's hair didn't
curl what you might call naturally, like yours, it was
very easy to curl, and it kept in something beautiful:
and it seemed very hard for your poor mamma to have
a boy whose curls had to be cut off and a girl who
hadn't any.  And then her ladyship's children were
her ladyship's children, and not like ordinary common
folk."  Ponty's logic always roused my wonder and
admiration.
</p>

<p>
While she was speaking, my wandering gaze fell
upon two portraits hung on the nursery wall: a fat
little girl with pink cheeks and blue eyes, and stiff
curls like great yellow sausages, who was dressed in
a white frock and a blue sash; and a thin, little,
dark-eyed boy with pale cheeks and terrible brown ringlets,
and who was disfigured still further by a green velvet
suit and a ghastly lace collar.  These caricatures were
supposed to reproduce Annabel and myself in early
youth; and in Ponty's eyes they represented the
perfection of personal beauty as depicted by the
highest form of human art.
</p>

<p>
But while I smiled&mdash;as I had often smiled before&mdash;at
the hideousness of these pictures, a great wave of
envy of the children whom they represented swept over
me; an overwhelming longing to be once more the
sheltered little boy in the frightful green suit, whose
world was Annabel and whose Heaven was Ponty and
his mother.  Happy little boy, upon whose wrath the
sun never went down, and who knew no sorrow so
great that his mother could not cure it!  I would
gladly have changed places with him, even though the
change involved the handicaps of long brown curls
and a large lace collar.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
ISABEL, <i>née</i> CARNABY
</h3>

<p>
Arthur and Annabel were married very quietly at
Restham Church; and, after a short honeymoon, took
up their abode at The Deanery of Lowchester&mdash;a
beautiful old house which fulfilled my sister's most
exorbitant dreams.
</p>

<p>
I did not appoint Arthur's successor: I felt I was
too much out of touch with things spiritual to be
competent to undertake so solemn a responsibility: so I
gave the matter over into the Bishop's hands, and
left the selection of a new rector to him.
</p>

<p>
With the simplicity which has always characterised
my views regarding that other world which is known
to us as the Kingdom of Heaven, I accepted the fact
that as long as Frank Wildacre was unforgiven by me
I had no right to expect help from on High in any
of my undertakings.  How could I claim the rights of
citizenship if I did not conform to the rules of
citizenship?  The rule was there in black and white for
everybody to read: "If ye forgive not men their
trespasses neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses."  And how could I ask my Father in Heaven
to fulfil His part of the contract, unless I were ready
to fulfil mine?
</p>

<p>
And I was not ready: I was no readier than I had
been when Frank Wildacre stole my wife away from
me a year and a half ago.  My anger against him was
hotter and bitterer than it had ever been: time seemed
to increase rather than to diminish its intensity.  I
advisedly say Frank, as my heart was gradually
softening towards my darling.  I still was set against
making the first advances: but I felt that if she would
only come back to me of her own free will, I was
prepared to let bygones be bygones, and to take up
the thread of our married life again exactly where she
had broken it off.  At least that is how I felt
sometimes: at others I was plunged in despair by the
thought that everything was over for ever between
Fay and myself, and that I should never see her dear
face again.  But even in my more hopeful moods I
recognised that it would be impossible for Fay and
Annabel to live together again; and that it was,
therefore, a good thing on the whole that Arthur had
transplanted my sister from Restham to Lowchester.
</p>

<p>
But although I was sometimes ungracious enough
to feel relieved by the removal of Annabel's restraining
presence, there were times when my loneliness and
desolation seemed almost more than I could bear.
Though in one way I could not miss Fay more than
I had done for the past eighteen months, in another
way the absence of any feminine influence in the house
seemed to emphasise her absence as it had never been
emphasised before.  As long as Annabel was still
there, I only, so to speak, missed my wife personally:
but after Annabel had gone away I missed Fay officially
as well.  I had always missed her in the spirit,
but now I also missed her in the letter: and my active
yearning for her was supplemented by a passive need.
And underneath all my emotions&mdash;underneath even
my love and longing for Fay&mdash;there was ever with me
the consciousness of that condition which was known
as "excommunication" in the Mediæval Church and
as "conviction of sin" in the Evangelical Revival.
I was not beyond reach of the love of God&mdash;no one
could be that: but I was outside the pale of what
old-fashioned theologists could call "His covenanted
mercies."  I did not think of myself as a lost soul:
that expression was robbed of all meaning for me after
I once realised with my heart as well as with my head
Who it was That came to seek and to save that which
was lost: but I knew that I was in the plight of that
servant who, though His Lord forgave him his debt,
failed to extend the like clemency to his fellow-servant,
and so was cast into prison and not allowed to
come thence until he should have paid the uttermost
farthing.  To use the beautiful language of our
forefathers, I was no longer at peace with God.
</p>

<p>
This to me was the most terrible part of my sorrow.
Fay's going had taken all the sunshine out of life:
but this took away even the security of death.  There
seemed no hope for me anywhere.
</p>

<p>
I knew perfectly well that I myself was my own
Hell: that it was nothing but my attitude towards
Frank that consigned me to this outer darkness.
Yet&mdash;knowing this&mdash;I could not bring myself to condone
the wrong which he had done me.  It was not that I
wouldn't forgive him: I would willingly have pardoned
him if I could; at least, so I thought at the time, and
so I think still, but one can never quite trust the
deceitfulness of the human heart.  Whether I <i>would</i> not, or
whether I <i>could</i> not forgive Frank Wildacre, God only
knoweth; but anyway I <i>did</i> not forgive him: and
consequently my soul went out into the wilderness to perish
alone like the scapegoat of old, and my spiritual
wretchedness assumed proportions beyond the
description of any form of words.
</p>

<p>
It was in the spring after Annabel's marriage that
I received the following letter from Lady Chayford&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR REGGIE,
</p>

<p>
"As the number of one's years grows more, and
the number of one's friends correspondingly less, one
feels compelled to grapple the residue to one's heart
with hoops of steel.  Therefore please come to us for
a week-end and be grappled.
</p>

<p>
"Besides, we want to show you this great Babylon
that we have built, and wherein we are now abiding.
It is such a comfort to be securely planted in a country
home of one's own, after having been potted-out for
years in furnished houses; and the facts that our
particular Babylon is not at all great, and that its
hot-water supply leaves much to be desired in the way of
heat, in no way imperil our fundamental happiness
in the creation of our own hands.  And the garden is
lovely, although we cannot live in it entirely until
it has been thoroughly aired, as both Paul and I have
been indulging in those Entreat-me-not-to-leave-thee
sort of colds which are so prevalent just now.  Therefore
so far we can only take walking exercise under
our own vine and fig-tree: it is too cold to sit under
them at present.
</p>

<p>
"I send you a selection of all the week-ends between
now and Easter to choose from.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Always your friend,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ISABEL CHAYFORD.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Isabel's letter was kind, like herself; and it was
kind of her to take pity on a lonely and desolate man
like me: but all the same, I did not avail myself of
her kindness.
</p>

<p>
I knew that it would be indeed a sort of comfort
to tell her all my troubles, and to ask for her opinion
the tragedy of my life, and she was the only person
to whom I felt I could speak freely about the blow
which had fallen on me.  I believe that a truly manly
man locks up all his sorrows in his own breast, and
throws the key into the dust-bin of dead memories.
But I have never been the sort of manly creature that
female novelists delight to honour.  There is a great
strain of woman in me, and always has been: and not
the most heroic sort of woman, either.
</p>

<p>
But though I longed for the consolation and counsel
of Isabel, I felt that in my present morbid condition
I could not stand the principles and politics of Paul.
In the old days I had put up with Paul on account
of Isabel: now I gave up Isabel on account of Paul.
The difference was merely chronological.  When we
are young, the pleasure of anything always swallows
up the attendant pain: as we grow older, the
attendant pain swallows up any possible pleasure.  And
that is life.
</p>

<p>
So I refused Lady Chayford's kind invitation.
</p>

<p>
But the woman who had once been Isabel Carnaby
was not the woman to be put off by a mere refusal.
So she invited herself to motor over and have lunch
with me instead: and she never even suggested to
bring his lordship with her.
</p>

<p>
She was one of those rare people&mdash;and most especially
rare women&mdash;who could put herself in another
person's place: and though at one time she had wanted
Paul Seaton dreadfully&mdash;wanted him more than anything
in the world&mdash;she was still capable of knowing
that at another time I might not want him at all.  And
she acted upon this knowledge.
</p>

<p>
She arrived just in time for luncheon, and of course
we could talk of only surface matters as long as the
servants were coming in and out of the room.  But
it was a comfort to hear her talk, even of only surface
matters, and to feel her feminine presence in the house.
</p>

<p>
Of course Annabel often came over to see me, and
to have what she called her eye upon my establishment:
in fact, she seemed to keep one eye always at
Restham, as some men always keep a change of clothes
at their Club; but Annabel's was never a "feminine
presence," in the sense that Isabel's and Fay's were.
Even the cult of the "Ladies' Needlework Guild,"
ultra-feminine though the name of the fetish sounds, had
never taken away the true gentlemanliness from
Annabel.  I now always called my sister and her husband
"the Dean and the Sub-Dean."  They thought that
by the "Sub-Dean" I meant Annabel.  But I did not.
</p>

<p>
When lunch was over and we were having coffee
in the great hall, Isabel settled herself comfortably
on the big Chesterfield by the fire.  Unlike most
women, she could sit for hours with unoccupied hands.
Though her tongue was never idle, her hands often
were.  To me there had always been something fatiguing
in the ceaseless travail of Annabel's fingers.  I
don't remember ever seeing them at rest, except on
a Sunday; and even then they were not unoccupied:
they always held some book or other containing sound
Evangelical doctrine.  But just now Isabel's hands
held nothing: and the sight somehow rested me.
</p>

<p>
"Please begin to smoke at once, Reggie," she said:
"I shan't enjoy myself a bit if you don't.  I shall get
exhausted like people do in Egypt, and places like
that, when there is no atmosphere, don't you
know?&mdash;nothing but black Pyramids and bright yellow sand,
till everybody thirsts for a real London fog."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head where the once dark hair was
beginning to turn grey.  "No.  I'm not really modern,
you know: I've advanced as far as motor-cars and
the economic position of women and central heating,
but I draw the line at smoking and going in flying
machines and wearing pyjamas.  I'm really almost
grandmotherly in some things."
</p>

<p>
I demurred.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am," she persisted.  "If I were modern, I
should draw out my own little cigarette-case and offer
you an Egyptian or a Virginian, as if I were a
slave-driver in the Babylonian marriage market: but as it
is, you must consume your own smoke like a
manufacturing chimney.  As I told you once before, I
budded in the 'eighties and blossomed in the 'nineties,
and now I'm only fit to be sewn up in lavender-bags
and kept in the linen-cupboard.  And now, Reggie,
tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
So I told her, as briefly and truthfully as I could,
the whole story of my married life and its culminating
tragedy.  I told of how doubtful I had been from the
beginning of my power to make Fay happy: of my
qualms of conscience as to whether at my age I had
a right to ask so young a girl to marry me: of how
Annabel and Frank&mdash;especially Frank&mdash;had gradually
come between Fay and me: of how I had hated the
theatrical entertainments and all that they involved,
and yet for Fay's sake had upheld them in the teeth
of Annabel's opposition: of how further events had
proved that Annabel was right and I was wrong, since
the passion for acting&mdash;in conjunction with Frank's
influence&mdash;had finally driven Fay from me: of my
increasing anger against Frank and my incapacity to
forgive him: of my former gift of healing and of how
my enmity towards him had deprived me of this gift:
and finally of how this increasing and consuming
hatred had driven me into the wilderness, and shut
me out from communion with God or man.  All this
I told without enlargement or restraint.  But from
one thing I strenuously refrained: I said no word of
blame nor uttered a single complaint against my
darling.  Surely, as her husband, this was the least
that I could do.  She had weighed me in her balances
and found me wanting and rejected me: but she was
still my wife, and my loyalty to her was unshaken.
</p>

<p>
All the time that I was pouring into Isabel's sympathetic
ears the feelings that had been pent up in my
own breast for two years, she hardly spoke a word:
but her blue eyes never left my face, and I felt in every
fibre of me that she sympathised and understood.
</p>

<p>
When I had finished there was a short silence,
during which I waited for her verdict, wondering
whether she would blame me or Frank or Annabel:
or merely insist on the irrevocableness of the marriage-vow;
and suggest that I should endeavour&mdash;by means
of that exploded blunderbuss called marital authority&mdash;to
compel my wife to come back to me, whether she
wished it or whether she did not.
</p>

<p>
But to my surprise Lady Chayford did none of these
things.  Her first words were&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You're up against it now, Reggie: what you've
got to do is to forgive Frank Wildacre."
</p>

<p>
"But I can't," I cried: "it is absolutely impossible."
</p>

<p>
Isabel nodded her head.  "I know that.  It was
absolutely impossible for the sick and the maimed
and the halt to take up their beds and walk: but they
did it."
</p>

<p>
"Frank has entirely spoilt my life: I can never
forgive him&mdash;never," I pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"But you'll have to, Reggie: there's no getting
away from it and the more impossible it is, the more
you'll have to do it.  Don't think I'm not sorry for
you, or don't understand how hideous it all is, for I
am and do: but there's no use in shutting your eyes
to the truth.  Lots of people would tell you not to
bother about Frank at all, but to give your whole
attention to Fay and how to get her back again, and
they would add that your first duty is to your wife."
</p>

<p>
"And so it is," I cried.
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't, Reggie, and you know it.  Your first
duty is to God: and if the Bible means anything, it
means that if we don't forgive other people we don't
get forgiveness ourselves.  I don't want to preach at
you, goodness knows, or to be priggish or anything
of that kind: and I know it sounds awfully antiquated
and Victorian to 'be good, sweet maid, and let who
will be clever,' but, all the same, as you grow older,
you learn that it's the only thing that really counts."
</p>

<p>
I groaned.  I knew so well that Isabel was right.
</p>

<p>
"Of course there have been faults all round&mdash;plenty
of them," she went on; "and it seems to me that while
Annabel and Frank were busy doing that which they
ought not to have done, you were equally busy leaving
undone that which you ought to have done: but that's
neither here nor there.  It's no good bothering over
the day that's past and over: what we've got to do
is to see that to-morrow is an improvement on it: and
the job to hand at present is that before you do
anything else you've got to forgive Frank Wildacre."
</p>

<p>
"Damn him!" I exclaimed, getting up from my
chair and kicking the logs in the fireplace as if they
had been Frank himself.
</p>

<p>
Isabel smiled sweetly.  "That's all very well, Reggie;
but you aren't damning him, you see: you're only
damning yourself.  That's my whole point."
</p>

<p>
I began to walk up and down the great hall.  This
was plain speaking indeed.
</p>

<p>
"I know I'm being very horrid," she went on, "and
I don't wonder you detest me.  I feel like that man
in the Bible&mdash;Balaam, wasn't it?&mdash;who was invited
out to curse somebody and blessed them instead:
only it is just the other way round with me.  But,
all the same, you'll never be happy, and Fay will never
be happy, until you forgive Frank.  Of course, you've
got to forgive Fay too, and you haven't really done
that yet: but you soon will when you see her again.
I'm not worrying about that.  The nut to crack is
not Fay but Frank."
</p>

<p>
And that was all the comfort I got from Isabel
Chayford.  From the depths of my desolate heart I knew
that what Isabel said was true: and equally from the
depths of my soul I knew that as long as he lived I
could never forgive Frank Wildacre.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
THE GREAT WAR
</h3>

<p>
Isabel Chayford came over to see me in the early
spring, and immediately after Easter, Annabel, Arthur
and I went for a short trip to the Canary Isles.  Now
that she was Dean and Chapter of Lowchester, Annabel
had not as much time as formerly to stand between
me and the East wind: but she still did what she could;
and on this particular occasion hid me in the shelter
of the Canary Isles until the tyranny of my traditional
enemy was overpast.
</p>

<p>
Nothing particular happened during the early part
of the summer.  My longing for Fay and my hatred
of Frank were as great as they had ever been: neither
feeling seemed to diminish in intensity: and I felt that
forgiveness of Frank was as far from me as ever.
</p>

<p>
I was still very unhappy: but I had now been
unhappy for so long that I was fast coming to regard it
as my normal state.
</p>

<p>
I did not see much of the new Rector, though what
I did see I liked, and he was most popular in the
parish: but I was at war with the King, whose ambassador
he was, and I felt that, therefore, his embassage
meant nothing to me.
</p>

<p>
So the long, dreary, sunny days dragged on until the
beginning of August: and then suddenly the incredible
happened, and the world as we had known it was turned
upside down.
</p>

<p>
It is not for me to attempt to tell the story of the
Great War: that is already written in blood and tears
on the heart of the civilised world; and likewise on
the pages of those books which shall be opened before
the Great White Throne, when the earth and the
heaven shall flee away and there shall be found no
place for them.  Germany ruthlessly broke the laws of
God and of Man, and England upheld them and defended
them even to the death.  Hell was let loose
with all its furies, but the hosts of Heaven were also
in the field.
</p>

<p>
And whilst on the continent of Europe the awful
battle raged between Right and Might, between
Righteousness and Unrighteousness, between the
Prince of Peace and the Lust of Power, we at home
saw our old world tumbling about our ears, and a new
one rising phoenix-like from its ashes.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the whole scale of values was changed.  In
the old days before the War, the important people
were the middle-aged, wealthy, intellectual people, the
brains and backbone of the nation.  Now those people
had ceased to matter at all.  The only people that
mattered were the young and the strong and the
fearless, the blood and the sinews of the nation.  The
wisdom of the wise had become a thing of no moment
compared with the strength and the courage of the
brave.  It was the boys that counted now: not the
mature man of weight and position.  The old standards
had passed away and new ones were set up in their
place.  County magnates and landed proprietors sank
into abysmal insignificance beside the village lads in
their new khaki: rank and wealth became worthless,
except in so far as they could be adapted to serve the
soldiers fighting at the front.
</p>

<p>
The world which had hitherto bowed down before
us middle-aged, influential, well-to-do people, simply
because we were middle-aged and influential and
well-to-do, suddenly found it had no use for us, and so
cast us ruthlessly aside.  It had heavier work on
hand&mdash;work that was beyond our over-ripe powers.  And
the strange thing was that this casting aside did not
hurt our pride as it would have done at another time,
for the reason that our personal pride was dead, and
in its place had come a newer and a better feeling, the
sense of a corporate unity.  The boys who were
preferred before us were no rivals, but part of ourselves,
because we were all part of one great and united
Empire.  For the first time in the memory of living
men we knew experimentally what it meant to be
members one of another.
</p>

<p>
At the coming of the Great War old things passed
away and all things were made new, and life was
suddenly charged with a terrible and yet glorious meaning.
Our very prayers were changed.  For the first time
for a century we comprehended the Litany, and offered
it up with understanding hearts.  The "hands of our
enemies," which had for so long been merely figurative
dangers, were now an actual and hideous menace: and
because we believed we were fighting not for greed of
gain nor for lust of power, but for love of abstract
righteousness, we dared to raise from our hearts that
solemn and compelling plea: "O Lord, arise, help us
and deliver us for Thine honour."
</p>

<p>
Naturally I passionately wanted to enlist, and
equally naturally my age and short-sightedness
rendered me unable to respond to my country's need:
but for the first time in my life, failure had lost the
power to hurt me.  What mattered it that I was
worthless, if there were younger and better men ready
to take my place?  The individual unit had ceased to
signify.
</p>

<p>
Time also had changed its values.  Everything that
had happened before the war was almost lost in the
haze of a half-forgotten past: the trifling events of the
last week of July seemed as far off as the happenings
of my boyhood.  A new era had begun on that fateful
Fourth of August, nineteen hundred and fourteen.
</p>

<p>
It was only a few weeks according to the old reckoning
of time, though it seemed as if a long stretch of
years had elapsed since the setting of the sun of peace,
that another crushing blow fell, and I received the
following letter from Isabel Chayford&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"My DEAR REGGIE,
</p>

<p>
"I have terrible news to tell you&mdash;the very
worst&mdash;and trying to break it gently is no good at all.
I have seen Frank Wildacre, who has just come over
from Belgium with a lot of Belgian refugees and he
tells me that Fay is dead&mdash;killed by a shell at
Louvain."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I put the letter down as I could not see to read any
more.  A thick red mist was before my eyes, and my
brain reeled.
</p>

<p>
Fay dead&mdash;my beautiful, light-hearted little Fay!
The thought was unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
Yet though it was unthinkable, the certainty of
it crushed me to the earth.  I could not believe&mdash;I
felt I never could believe&mdash;that Fay was dead: yet
on the other hand I felt as if she had been dead for
years and years, and that I had always known
it.  Sorrow is always so old.  The moment that its
shadow touches us we feel that it has enshrouded us
for ages.
</p>

<p>
As long as I live I shall never forget the agony of
that moment.  The sun shone through the
dining-room window as I sat at the breakfast-table, and I
hated it for shining.  It seemed as if it ought never to
shine again now that Fay was dead.  And all the
familiar objects around me&mdash;the furniture and the
flowers and the breakfast-things&mdash;suddenly became
charged with a terrible and sinister meaning, as if
they were all part of a grotesque and unspeakably
horrible dream.
</p>

<p>
I sat for what seemed an eternity trying to realise,
though in vain, that Fay was dead; and yet feeling
that I had realised it, from the foundation of the
world, in every fibre of my being.
</p>

<p>
So it was all over, the joy and the pain of my married
life!  The breach between Fay and myself could never
now be healed.  There was now no longer any hope of
her coming back to me, and asking me to let bygones
be bygones and to begin our life together afresh.  The
bygones were bygones indeed, and there was no
beginning again for my darling and me.  Everything was
over and past, and there was nothing left&mdash;not even a
happy memory.  She could never again weigh me in
her balance, and this time more mercifully; nor could
she ever cross out that <i>Tekel</i> she had written against
my name.  It must stand for ever to my eternal
undoing.  The anguish of this thought was almost
more than I could bear, and yet live!
</p>

<p>
And across the intolerable anguish there came
another feeling&mdash;an intensity of hatred against him
who had destroyed the happiness of my life; and who
now came back to complete the havoc he had wrought,
by the news of my darling's death.  If I had found
it impossible to forgive Frank while Fay was alive, I
found it still more impossible now!
</p>

<p>
After an eternity of such agony as I trust never to
go through again, it occurred to me to finish reading
Isabel's letter.  There was nothing in it that could
matter: nothing could ever matter any more now that
Fay was dead: but I felt I might as well read it.  I
had a dim feeling that Isabel sympathised and was
sorry, but I did not care whether she was sorry or not.
Neither she nor anybody else could ever help me any
more.  Still she meant to be kind; and though her
kindness was of no use to me, I thought I might as
well finish her letter.  I owed that much to her.  So I
went on with the reading of the letter that I had begun
to read ages ago, in that dim, far-off past before I
knew that Fay was dead.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"It appears," the letter continued, "that Fay and
Frank had come over for a trip through Belgium when
the war began, as Fay was rather overdone by acting
and wanted a thorough rest and change: and instead
of trying to get away at once, they stayed on at
Louvain in order to help to look after the wounded.
During the deliberate destruction of the town, Fay
rushed out of cover to save a child that had run into
the street by itself; and in so doing was struck by
part of a shell, which killed her.  So she died to
save another, which is the most splendid death of all.
</p>

<p>
"Frank was so prostrated by the shock that he could
no longer help to nurse the wounded, so he got away,
and came over to England with a lot of Belgian
refugees.  I found him among these immediately after
his arrival in London, and knew him at once from his
strong resemblance to Fay.  I brought him home with
me to Prince's Gate, as he looked far too fragile and
delicate to be left among strangers; and he is here
now&mdash;an absolute wreck.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shall only be too glad for Fay's sake
to keep him here and nurse him back to health: but
he doesn't want to stay here: he wants to go back to
you.
</p>

<p>
"I have told him how you blame him&mdash;and justly
so&mdash;for all that has happened, and how impossible you
find it to forgive him.  I haven't spared him at all.
But in spite of all that I have said he still persists that
he wants to go back to Restham.  He is dreadfully
sorry for what he has done: but of course that doesn't
mend anything.
</p>

<p>
"Reggie, don't think it is unfeeling of me to bother
you about all this now.  I need not tell you how
deeply I grieve for you in your crushing sorrow, nor
how fully I realise that you are beyond the reach of
any grief or sympathy of mine.  All this you know
better than I could tell you.  But I feel I must tell
you that Frank repents, and that he wants to come
back to you from the far country.  This may be your
one chance of learning how to forgive your enemy:
and I dare not stand between any man and his hope
of salvation.  So I just tell you the facts: and leave
results in your hands&mdash;and God's.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Ever yours, in truest sympathy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ISABEL CHAYFORD."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Yes, Isabel meant well.  I was sure of that: though
her meaning was of no moment to me.  But what she
asked was impossible.  If I could not forgive Frank
when Fay was alive and there was still the chance of
things coming right again between my darling and
me, how could I forgive him now, when the mischief
he had wrought was irremediable, and my life was
spoiled beyond redemption?
</p>

<p>
No: I felt that Isabel, and&mdash;I say it in all
reverence&mdash;even God Himself were asking too much of me.
</p>

<p>
The forgiveness of Frank Wildacre was a demand
too exorbitant to be met by a man who was suffering
as I was suffering.  I could never forgive him&mdash;never:
especially now that Fay was dead.  And suddenly,
through the clouds of my spiritual anguish and across
the storms of my passionate rebellion, I seemed to hear
a Voice which said: "Behold, I stand at the door,
and knock!"
</p>

<p>
But I would not heed it.
</p>

<p>
I pushed my untasted breakfast away from me and
rang the bell.  Jeavons answered it, and I heard myself
saying to him in a voice that I did not recognise
as my own&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Let all the blinds be pulled down at once.  Her
ladyship is dead."
</p>

<p>
Then&mdash;before he could utter the commonplace
condolences which I felt would kill me&mdash;I went along the
passage to the library and shut the door: and I sat
down at my writing-table and laid my head on my
arms and wept like a child.  And there was none to
comfort me.
</p>

<p>
Everybody was very kind to me for the next few
days, with that combination of fear and pity which
we always show towards the newly bereaved, and
which sets these apart from their fellows as completely
as if they were lepers.  Arthur and Annabel came over
at once from the Deanery, and vainly endeavoured to
console me in their different ways: Annabel by letting
me see what a sacrifice she had made on my behalf
by leaving Lowchester, even for a day, with all the
work&mdash;Red Cross and otherwise&mdash;which the war had
thrown on her hands: and Arthur by saying hardly
anything at all, but gazing at me with the eyes of a
faithful dog.
</p>

<p>
And all the time that still small Voice kept
sounding in my ears: "Behold, I stand at the door, and
knock!"
</p>

<p>
I showed Arthur and Annabel Isabel's letter, and
awaited their comments upon it.
</p>

<p>
Annabel was very indignant with Lady Chayford.
"It is just like Isabel to begin bothering you about
Frank at a time like this!" she exclaimed: "but she
never did have any sense.  As if you hadn't trouble
enough, poor dear boy, without her trying to thrust
Belgian refugees on to your shoulders as well!"
</p>

<p>
"I could not possibly have Frank here," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you couldn't," replied my sister: "it
would be most upsetting to you, with his likeness to
Fay, and the way in which he has treated you, and
all!  I cannot conceive what induced Isabel Chayford
to make such an improper suggestion.  But she always
was utterly inconsiderate of other people's feelings."
</p>

<p>
My sense of justice rebelled at this.  "I don't think
you are quite fair to her there, Annabel.  Isabel may
be unwise, but she is never inconsiderate."
</p>

<p>
"Well, at any rate, she used to be," retorted
Annabel; "and what people used to be they generally
are."
</p>

<p>
I could not deny the truth of this statement, broadly
speaking: and I had not the spirit to point out that
there might be exceptions.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think?" I asked, appealing to Arthur.
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a moment; then he said in his
slow, grave way: "It is very difficult to judge for
other people, and I agree with Annabel that had I been
in Lady Chayford's place I should never have ventured
to make such a daring suggestion.  But I cannot help
feeling that she is right when she says that it may be
your one chance."
</p>

<p>
"That is just Isabel's nonsense," interpolated
Annabel.  "I haven't patience with her.  As if Frank
Wildacre deserved to be forgiven!  And even if he
did&mdash;which he doesn't&mdash;it isn't the time to bother poor
Reggie about it now."
</p>

<p>
"I can never forgive him," I repeated.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say you could, old man," replied Arthur:
"neither does Lady Chayford.  She only says that this
might be your one opportunity of doing so: not that
you could necessarily avail yourself of that opportunity.
As I take it, she does not suggest to you to
forgive Frank, but to put yourself in a position where
it might become possible for you to forgive him.
There is a difference between the two, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I can never forgive him," I repeated doggedly.
And we left it at that.
</p>

<p>
Annabel pressed me to go back to Lowchester with
her and Arthur: but I declined to do that, or even to
let them remain at Restham with me.  I wanted to
be alone with my sorrow.  And as they had their
hands full of all kinds of work connected with the war
and could ill be spared from Lowchester, they let me
have my way.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a short note to Isabel Chayford thanking
her for her sympathy in my overwhelming sorrow: and
saying that I found it impossible to grant Frank's wish
and to let him come to Restham.  And then I sat alone
in my house that was left unto me desolate, and
mourned my dead.
</p>

<p>
But was I alone?
</p>

<p>
Through the long sunless days and the dreary
sleepless nights that Voice kept ringing in my
ears&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock!"
</p>

<p>
And I knew that the Hand that knocked was
pierced; yet I steeled my soul against that incessant
pleading, and kept fast shut the door.
</p>

<p>
Some æons of agony passed&mdash;I think in reality it was
three or four days as happy people count them&mdash;and
Arthur came over to see me again.
</p>

<p>
We sat chiefly in silence, or else talked about
impersonal matters, Arthur looking at me all the time
with his dog-like eyes.  But just as he was leaving he
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have you thought any more about Lady Chayford's
suggestion, old man?"
</p>

<p>
"I have thought about nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't you think you might do as&mdash;as&mdash;she
suggests?" he asked timidly: then: "for Fay's sake,"
he added, almost in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
I turned round upon him quickly.
</p>

<p>
"If I consent to have Frank Wildacre here, I shall
not do it for Fay's sake," I said, "but for Christ's
sake."
</p>

<p>
And as I uttered the three words which are the
greatest lever of power, both human and Divine,
which the world has ever known&mdash;those words whereby
Man is permitted to control the Actions of even God
Himself&mdash;I knew that at last the door had been opened
to Him Who stood outside and knocked.  Once again
the Galilean had conquered.

CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
THE LAST OF THE WILDACRES
</h3>

<p>
I wrote to Isabel that I had changed my mind, and
that I consented to have Frank at Restham for his
convalescence: but I asked her to make it quite clear
to him that I felt it as impossible now as I did two
years ago to forgive him for having come between my
wife and myself.  I did not want to have him at the
Manor on false pretences that everything was going
to be smoothed over and made easy for him, as it had
been always before: for even if such condoning of his
fault had been possible on my part (which it was not),
I knew him well enough to realise that it would be
extremely bad for him.
</p>

<p>
The fiat had gone forth from the altar of Restham
Church on the occasion of my marriage with Fay:
"Those whom God hath joined together let no man
put asunder."  Frank had done his best to put asunder
two Divinely united persons, and had succeeded.
Therefore I felt it was but meet that he should be
punished as he deserved.  To be allowed to sin with
impunity is the most terrible curse that can fall on
the head of any man: and I had no intention of
becoming the instrument whereby this curse should be
directed to the head of Frank Wildacre.
</p>

<p>
Isabel sent him down to Restham in her car, and it
was on a gloomy autumn day that he arrived.  I met
him at the door, and at the first moment was struck
afresh by his marvellous likeness to Fay: it seemed
almost as if my dead darling had come back to me,
and for a second I was well-nigh unmanned.  But
after Jeavons had helped him in and laid him down
on the large Chesterfield by the hall fire, I saw that
he was not as much like Fay as I had at first thought.
Both the Wildacres had always been slight and
slender, but it was the slightness and slenderness of
perfect health: now Frank's thinness amounted to
positive emaciation, and his face was pinched and
peaked.  Moreover, he had lost that appearance of
essential and eternal youth which had been so marked
a characteristic of him and of Fay, and without which
he hardly seemed a Wildacre at all.
</p>

<p>
But in one thing he was unchanged, and that was
in his perfect ease of manner and absolute
unself-consciousness.  Although I could see that it required all
his self-control to enable him to respond naturally to
my greeting, as indeed it required all my self-control
to give it, nevertheless he succeeded: and I could not
help admiring the pluck and courage of the boy when
I remembered how much lay between his departure
from the Manor and his return to it.
</p>

<p>
As I recalled what bright and beautiful beings
Wildacre and his children had been at one time, and
realised that this broken wreck of a boy was all that
was left of the once brilliant trio, a wave of misery
at the pity of it all swept over my soul.  I thought of
Wildacre as he used to be in the old boyish days, and
then of Frank and Fay when they first came to the
Rectory after their father's death: and I felt that I
was face to face with the hopeless tragedy of what
might have been but was not, because the folly and
sin of man frustrated the Wisdom and Righteousness
of God, as for some hidden reason it has been
permitted to do ever since the forbidden tree was planted
in the midst of the garden.
</p>

<p>
And that is how the last of the Wildacres came to
Restham.
</p>

<p>
For some days I saw but little of Frank.  Ponty
took him into her tender keeping and set about
nursing him back to health, only allowing him to come
downstairs and lie on the Chesterfield couch by the
hall fire for a few hours every day.  It was astonishing
to me to find Ponty so good to Frank.  She had
always resented his presence at Restham even before
he had worked any mischief there: yet now she took
him into her charge, and nursed him as devotedly as
if she had been his mother.
</p>

<p>
I remarked upon this change of front one day.  "I
am surprised you are so kind to Mr. Wildacre, Ponty,
considering how angry you were when first I asked
him to come and live at the Manor.  I was afraid you
wouldn't like his coming back in this way."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, Master Reggie, when I was that
set against his coming to the Manor, he was strong
and well, and so could stand up to me, as you might
say: but now he is too weak and ill to hurt a fly.
There's lots of folks as you can't stand at any price
when they are able to stick up for themselves: but
when they are knocked down you'd do anything you
could to help them to get up again."
</p>

<p>
"Women are made like that&mdash;thank God!" I said.
</p>

<p>
"I remember there was a girl at Poppenhall who'd
had a fine upstanding young man after her for years
and years, and she couldn't so much as look at him,
though all the other girls envied her for having such
a handsome beau: but he lost an arm and got his face
scarred in an accident down a coal-pit, and then she
married him at once, and spent the rest of her life
in looking after him and trying to take the place of his
lost arm."
</p>

<p>
"A woman all over!" I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"And all the same, Master Reggie, I'm not such a
woman as you seem to think&mdash;though I dare say I'm
as weak as most of them if I'm taken the right way:
but it was one thing to have Mr. Wildacre here when
I felt it in my bones that he'd come between you and
her dear young ladyship, and quite another to have
him here when there is nobody to come between.  It
wasn't that I objected to Mr. Wildacre himself&mdash;far
from it&mdash;any more than I objected to Miss Annabel,
whom I'd had from a month old: but what I did say&mdash;and
always shall say&mdash;is that it's best for married
people to fight things out for themselves, without
having any relations on either side to back them up.  And
I shall stick to this till my dying day, even if I was
to hang for it!"
</p>

<p>
I had no intention of hanging my old nurse when
she talked in this strain, but I had every objection
to listening to her.  So I closed the conversation by
going out of the nursery.
</p>

<p>
Annabel came over to see Frank a few days after
his arrival at Restham: but Ponty, who was paramount
in the sick room, forbade her entrance.  I had
already perceived that my sister's despotic sway at the
Manor was gradually being undermined, in secret and
insidious ways, by the redoubtable Ponty, whenever
a suitable opportunity presented itself.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to let Miss Annabel see Mr. Wildacre
till he is stronger," my old nurse said: "she's no
good in a sick room isn't Miss Annabel, being far too
managing and interfering for invalids.  And after all
that poor young gentleman has gone through, it would
be heathen cruelty to upset him still worse.  Miss
Annabel on the top of the Germans would be too much
for anybody!"
</p>

<p>
"But Miss Annabel, as you call her, used to be so
fond of Mr. Wildacre," I pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Not after he crossed her will and ran off with her
ladyship.  You could put on the top of a threepenny-bit
all Miss Annabel's love for them as don't do exactly
as she tells them, and have room to spare.  If she
is as fond of Mr. Wildacre as she used to be, she can
go on with it as soon as he is strong again, and able to
stand her domineering ways; though there won't be
much fondness to go on with, if I know Miss Annabel.
But as long as he's ill, and in my charge, I can't have
him bothered with nobody&mdash;not even with Deans and
Chapters and all other dignities of the Church, including
Miss Annabel.  And so I tell you straight, Master
Reggie."
</p>

<p>
And Ponty had her way, having found a secret
supporter in my humble self.
</p>

<p>
As Frank under Ponty's care grew stronger, I saw
more of him, and we gradually got into the way of
talking naturally about my lost darling.  He could
not bear even yet to say much about his awful
experiences during that terrible time at Louvain; but he
repeated the story of how Fay had given her life to
save another's after risking it for some time in order
to tend the sick and wounded.  And that made me
love her all the more dearly, and mourn her all the
more deeply.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to bother you, Reggie," he said one
day, when relations had grown less strained between
us; "but I just want you to know how dreadfully sorry
I am that I behaved as I did.  Lady Chayford told
me that you couldn't forgive me, and I feel I haven't
the right to ask you to forgive me.  But I just want
to tell you that I am sorry, and that I would give my
life to undo what I did."
</p>

<p>
He was lying in his usual place on the couch, and
I was sitting in an easy-chair on the other side of the
great fire-place.  For a few seconds I smoked in silence:
then I said: "I hope you understand it isn't that I
<i>won't</i> forgive you, Frank, but that <i>I can't</i>.  I've tried,
and I find it impossible."
</p>

<p>
Frank nodded his head in the way that reminded
me so keenly of Fay.  "I know: Lady Chayford told
me.  And she also told me how not forgiving me had
made you lose your wonderful gift of healing.  It is
dreadful to think that I had power to spoil your life
as much as that!"
</p>

<p>
I smiled sadly at the childishness which made the
loss of my healing powers seem greater than the loss
of Fay.  And then my smile faded as I realised that
it is only when we speak as little children that we
speak truth; for the loss of my healing powers stood
sacramentally for more than even the loss of my wife.
It was the outward and visible sign of my separation
from God.
</p>

<p>
"I know it's no good saying I'm sorry now, but I
must say it," Frank continued; "and I shall go on
feeling it as long as I live.  I don't really see how you
could forgive me: I know I couldn't if I were in your
place.  In fact, I shouldn't even want to."
</p>

<p>
"I do want to," I said slowly; "but I can't."
</p>

<p>
"But although I own I did my best towards the
end to induce Fay to come away with me," continued
Frank, in that throaty and rather husky voice which
was so like Fay's that sometimes it thrilled my
heart-strings to breaking-point, "I can't help saying that
she oughtn't to have listened to me.  After all, she was
bound to you by vows, and I wasn't."
</p>

<p>
I lifted up my hand in protest.  "Hush, hush!" I
said sternly: "I cannot allow you or anybody else to
dare to say a word against my wife."
</p>

<p>
"You are very loyal to her," he replied, after a
short pause, in which I did him the justice to believe
that he felt ashamed of himself.
</p>

<p>
"I loved her," I said.  Then I corrected myself:
"I mean I love her."
</p>

<p>
But it was not easy to suppress a Wildacre even
when he did feel ashamed of himself.  "Then you
have forgiven her," said Frank: "Lady Chayford told
me you hadn't."
</p>

<p>
There was a few minutes' silence whilst I tried to
be honest with Frank and with myself.  Then I said
slowly: "I don't believe I really did forgive her
altogether till I heard of her death, though I loved her
all the time more than I loved life itself.  But after
she died I gradually realised that there was nothing
to forgive.  I had been weighed in her balance, and
had been found wanting, and she had no further use
for me: therefore she threw me on one side as worthless.
I was hers to do what she liked with, and she
had a perfect right to retain or to reject me as she
thought fit.  But, mind you, I didn't see this at first.
I am no better than my neighbours, and for a long
time I was as harsh and bitter and vindictive as any
poor beggar of the so-called 'criminal classes' could
have been in the circumstances.  It is only since Fay's
death that I have realised that she was justified in the
course she took."
</p>

<p>
"But she wasn't&mdash;&mdash;" Frank began; but I stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  Say what you like about yourself, my
boy, but not a word against Fay.  And don't think
that because I completely exonerate her I also
exonerate you.  For I don't.  Whatever lay between
her and me, was sacred to her and me, and no one had
any right to intermeddle in it.  Neither had you nor
anybody else a right to try to put asunder those whom
God had joined together: and that&mdash;unless I do you
a grave injustice&mdash;is what you did."
</p>

<p>
Frank pondered on my words for a short time and
then he said: "To a certain extent, perhaps, I did
come between you and Fay, and, as I have told you,
I repent of what I did in dust and ashes.  But I never
meant to come between you.  On that score my
conscience is clear.  What I did do was to persuade her
to come away with me: but I never did that until
something or somebody had already come between you
and her, and I saw she was fretting her life out
because of it."
</p>

<p>
I was startled.  "Something had already come
between us!  What in Heaven's name do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It is rather difficult to explain, Reggie," replied
Frank, carefully weighing his words in his endeavour
to be lucid: "yet I think I must try to do so even if
I make a hash of it, because at present you are
absolutely in the dark about the whole affair.  As far as
I can make out, you think that Fay went away because
she didn't love you enough."
</p>

<p>
"That certainly was my impression," I said, trying
in vain to keep the pain out of my voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, you are off on a wrong scent
altogether.  Fay went away because she loved you too
much."
</p>

<p>
"Loved me too much!  I don't understand."  I
was dazed by Frank's incomprehensible burst of
confidence.
</p>

<p>
He did his best to make matters clearer.  No
Wildacre was ever at a loss for words.  "You see,
it was in this way: Fay absolutely adored you&mdash;simply
worshipped the ground you walked on.  I'm
not justifying her for feeling like this," he added, with
the first touch of his old whimsicalness that he had
shown since his return; "I don't deny that it was very
foolish of her to set up any man as a god and worship
him like that: but that is what she did; and it is right
for you to know it, before you judge her for what she
did besides."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never judge her," I interpolated; "God
forbid!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, before you understand what she did,
if you prefer the word.  It really was Fay's absorbing
and unreasoning adoration of you that upset the
apple-cart and did all the mischief.  If she'd been more
sensible and discriminating, all this trouble would never
have happened: but she was young and foolish, and
madly in love at that.  And she was so wild with
jealousy, because she thought you loved your sister more
than you loved her, that she hardly knew what she
was doing."
</p>

<p>
"I thought she found me old and dull and
tiresome," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"I know you did, and that really was too idiotic
for anything!  Why, she was simply crazy for love
of you from the first time she saw you till the day
she ran away; but you footled the whole thing!  I'm
sorry to say it, Reggie, but you really did."
</p>

<p>
Amazement had rendered me humble.  I realised
that if any one had known Fay thoroughly, Frank
had; and it was as an expert that he spoke.  "Please
explain," I said meekly.
</p>

<p>
Nothing loth, he continued: "Well, if you want the
truth, you shall have it.  And of course you must bear
in mind that, if Fay hadn't been so ridiculously in love,
silly little things wouldn't have hurt her as they did,
and she wouldn't have gone off her head with jealousy
of Miss Kingsnorth.  I know men like to feel that
their wives are very much in love with them: but the
wives who aren't so much in love are really the best
for everyday wear.  They are more tolerant and much
less exacting."
</p>

<p>
Frank was a wiser man than he had been when he
left Restham.  I noted that.  And for the first time
a tiny doubt crept into my mind as to whether even
then he had been the most unwise man there.
</p>

<p>
"In the first place," he went on, "Fay was most
frightfully upset at your asking Miss Kingsnorth to
stay on living with you after you were married.  That
started the feeling."
</p>

<p>
"I thought that as Fay was still such a child it
would be a comfort to her to have a kind and loving
woman to turn to and lean upon," I explained.
</p>

<p>
"Kind and loving fiddlesticks!" retorted Frank, by
no means respectfully; but I was so glad to see him
once more a little like his old self that I rejoiced in
rather than resented his impertinence.  In spite of my
underlying enmity against him, I could not hide it from
myself that Frank had attracted and fascinated me
since his return as he had never attracted and fascinated
me before: and this in spite of the fact that his
good looks were faded, and his brilliance was
quenched.  "When girls are first married they don't
want kind and loving women to lean upon: they want
to lean upon the husbands whose business it is to be
leant upon.  And they hate anybody who comes
between them and their husbands."
</p>

<p>
"But remember, Frank, I asked you to live with
us as well as Annabel.  It isn't as if I had asked my
sister, and left my wife's brother out."  I appeared
to be exculpating myself to Frank; but in reality I
was exculpating myself to myself.
</p>

<p>
"But that only made the matter worse.  Fay didn't
want me any more than she wanted Miss Kingsnorth
to come poking my nose in between you and her.  She
wanted you to herself."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid that she and Annabel did not get on
together as well as I had hoped," I said.
</p>

<p>
Frank shrugged his thin shoulders.  "They'd have
got on all right together in their proper places.  Fay
was quite fond of Miss Kingsnorth as a sister-in-law:
but when she found Miss Kingsnorth put in place of
her husband, why of course she kicked.  Anybody
would."
</p>

<p>
"Annabel wasn't put in place of her husband," I
argued.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she was; and of course the thing didn't work.
You seemed to have an idea that Fay's love was
transferable, like a ticket for a concert, and that if you
didn't use it your sister could.  But it's no good trying
to transfer other people's affections any more than it's
any use trying to change other people's religions.
You can take the old one away, but you can't give
them a new one in its place."
</p>

<p>
"But I never attempted to do such a ridiculous
thing," I argued.
</p>

<p>
But Frank was firm.  "Yes, you did.  Or, at any
rate, Fay thought you did, which comes to the same
thing as far as she was concerned, and that was what
made her so mad.  For instance, when she particularly
asked you to give her a Prayer Book with her
name written in it by you, so that religion and you
might all get mixed up together in her mind, and you
be part of religion and religion part of you, what did
you do?  You got Miss Kingsnorth to give her the
Prayer Book, so that Miss Kingsnorth should become
part of her religion instead of you!  Now it really
was absurd to expect Miss Kingsnorth&mdash;I beg her
pardon, I mean Mrs. Blathwayte&mdash;to become part of
anybody's religion, except of old Blathwayte's&mdash;I mean
the Dean's.  I suppose she's part of his religion now,
right enough.  But she wasn't the kind of person to be
ever part of Fay's religion, and I should have thought
you could have seen that for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Did Fay tell you that about the Prayer Book?"
I asked, with a stab of anguish.  It was incomprehensible
to me how my darling could have discussed, even
with her brother, things which lay entirely between
her and me.  I could never have talked to Annabel
about matters which concerned Fay and myself alone!
I should have regarded them as too sacred.  But that
is where men and women are so different from each
other, and where women are so much less reserved
than men.  I believe that good wives tell more about
their husbands than bad husbands ever tell about their
wives.
</p>

<p>
But good Heavens, how it hurt!
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Frank, quite unconscious of my
pain, "she told me everything.  And it was only after
she had told me everything, and I saw how miserable
you were making her by setting Miss Kingsnorth above
and before her that I began to urge her to run away
and begin life over again.  Of course I see now it was
wicked of me to do so, although I was so furious with
you for thinking more of your sister than of your wife;
and besides being wicked, it was useless.  Fay loved
you so much that being away from you didn't seem
to mend matters at all, but only to make them worse.
But I thought that when once she'd got away from
you and your treatment of her, she'd begin to forget
you, and be happy again as she was before she and
you had ever met.  But unfortunately I was wrong."
</p>

<p>
I groaned.  I couldn't help it.
</p>

<p>
"Then another time," Frank went on, the Wildacres
never having been denied freedom of utterance,
"she was almost mad with joy because you came all
the way from Restham to Liverpool Street to meet
her on her way home from Bythesea.  It looked as if
you really were as much in love with her as she was
with you.  And then you went and spoilt it all by
saying that you had come to please your sister.  Now,
I ask you, what wife could stand that?  I'm sure you
wouldn't have liked to feel that Fay married you in
order to please me: and in the same way she didn't
like to feel that you had married her to please
Mrs. Blathwayte."
</p>

<p>
"But it was absurd of her to feel like that!  She
must have known that I worshipped the very ground
she walked on, and that the only fly in my ointment
was that I felt I was too old and dull to make her
happy."
</p>

<p>
Frank still had me on the hip.  "Then that was
equally absurd of you!  Fay wasn't the only absurd
one apparently.  You see all the time that you were
inventing trouble by thinking that you were too old
and dull for her, she was inventing trouble by thinking
that she was too young and silly for you, and that
you were comparing her with your sister, and finding
her inferior.  And you know how mad a woman gets
when she thinks her husband likes anybody else more
than he likes her.  There's nothing she wouldn't do
to punish him and hurt herself at the same time!  And
that is how Fay got.  She was so wild at finding you
thought more of Miss Kingsnorth than you did of her,
that she didn't care what happened.  She thought you
despised her, and that simply finished her off
altogether.  And when she was unhappy she tried to
drown her unhappiness in theatricals and fallals of
that kind, which didn't really do her the slightest
good: but when husbands fail, women set up all sorts
of ridiculous scarecrows in their place.  It's the way
they're made, I suppose.  And when the theatricals
turned out to be no good in helping her to forget, she
took to travelling, and that was how we came to be
in Belgium when the war broke out.  But travelling
didn't really help her either, though she had an idea
that the old cities of Flanders might be rather
soothing.  But as things panned out they were quite the
reverse, and we'd far better have remained in
Australia!"
</p>

<p>
"It is all incredible to me," I said.
</p>

<p>
But Frank had no mercy.  "The long and the short
of it is you were so busy worrying yourself about the
relations between Fay and your sister, that you let
the relations between Fay and yourself slide.  And
that was really the only thing that mattered.  Then
Fay got it into her head that you regretted having
married her when you compared her with Miss
Kingsnorth and saw how young and silly she was in
comparison: and so she decided to leave you and your
sister once more alone together, as she believed that
that was what really could make you happy.  And even
now I can't help admitting that Miss Kingsnorth is
far more your sort than Fay was."
</p>

<p>
I was silent for a time.  The solid earth seemed
slipping away beneath my feet.  Then I said: "Do
you mean to tell me, on your word of honour, that
to the best of your belief neither you nor Annabel
tried to come between my wife and me?"
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation the answer came: "Certainly I
do.  I am positive that I never did, and in my own
mind I am equally certain that Mrs. Blathwayte never
did either.  But where I was to blame was that when
I saw matters had gone wrong, I tried to set them right
in my own way: and I think probably that is what
Mrs. Blathwayte tried to do also.  But there was some
excuse for us.  The happiness of her brother and my
sister mattered more to us than anything else in the
world.  Of course I see now that you asked Miss
Kingsnorth here on Fay's account, though it was a
ridiculous thing to do: but I own now you did it from
a right motive.  But Fay believed you did it because
you thought you would find her too young and silly
to be enough for you by herself, and so you wanted
your sister and me to relieve the tedium, and make
things more cheerful for you.  That was Fay's idea,
and I agreed with her.  And naturally I resented your
putting your sister before mine.  Any fellow would."
</p>

<p>
"I never meant to."
</p>

<p>
"But you did.  And it is for what we do that we
are punished&mdash;not for what we meant to do.  It is a
way of yours to mix up essentials with non-essentials,
and I expect always will be: I suppose you are made
like that, and can't help it.  But if you'd only realised
that the important thing was not how Fay and Miss
Kingsnorth got on together, but how Fay and you
got on together, all this misery would never have happened."
</p>

<p>
I felt I could bear no more: so I went out alone into
the autumn dusk to commune with my own soul on
the revelations which Frank had vouchsafed to me.
And when we met again, we did not refer to it, but
talked only on indifferent things.  For the boy not only
knew when to speak: with a wisdom beyond his years
he knew also when to be silent.
</p>

<p>
For several days I continued to commune with my
own soul on the matters which Frank had revealed to
me.  And as I did so the conviction gradually took
hold of me that I had been right in my ruthless decision
that as long as I lived I could never forgive the
man who had come between my wife and me: who
had left my house unto me desolate, and had driven
forth my darling to her death.
</p>

<p>
And then wherever I went I heard nothing but one
awful message: the dying leaves whispered it, the
dropping rain repeated it, and the autumn winds thundered
it in my ears: the message which long ago struck terror
and remorse to the heart of a great King struck terror
and remorse also to mine.  Wherever I went and
whatever I did I kept hearing the appalling word of
condemnation: "Thou art the man."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
THE PEACE OF GOD
</h3>

<p>
I awoke one morning with a strange feeling that
something wonderful had happened during the night:
and as my mind gradually cleared, I realised what that
something was.
</p>

<p>
I had forgiven Frank Wildacre.
</p>

<p>
Or, rather, I had come to the knowledge that there
was nothing to forgive: that the man whose insensate
folly had spoilt my life and Fay's was not Frank at
all, but myself.
</p>

<p>
But the result was the same.  After nearly three
years of the outer darkness I had come once more into
the light: I was at peace with Man and therefore with
God: and that seemed to be all that signified.
</p>

<p>
On myself I had no mercy.  I could not forgive
myself&mdash;I cannot forgive myself now&mdash;I never shall
forgive myself.  But that was a matter of no moment.
Self-pardon is never the way of salvation.  I knew&mdash;how
I knew I cannot tell, but I did know it&mdash;that
God had forgiven me: I believed from the depths of
my heart that Fay, with the more perfect comprehension
of those who are already on the Other Side,
had forgiven me also: therefore my self-condemnation
was no bar across the path of life, but rather a healthy
and permanent discipline of the soul.
</p>

<p>
With a joy beyond all earthly joy I rose and dressed
and went out into the hazy autumn morning.  It was
Sunday: and as I stood in the grey mist which still
lay over everything and which shrouded the garden
and the fields from my view, I heard the church-bell
ringing for the eight o'clock Celebration.  And for the
first time for more than two years that bell called to
me, and bade me come and take my place at the
Eucharistic Feast: for at last I was in love and charity
with all men, and intended to lead a new life.
</p>

<p>
I answered the Call and entered the Church which
was hallowed by the worship of centuries: and there
I made my confession to Almighty God, meekly
kneeling upon my knees, as the pilgrims had knelt
there ages and ages before me.  And as in lowly
adoration I partook of the Blessed Food Which Christ
Himself had ordained, I thereby received Him into my
heart by faith: and the peace of God, which passeth
all understanding, once more filled my heart and mind
with the knowledge and love of God and of His Son,
Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
And so I began life over again in that autumn morning
in Restham Church, at the beginning of the Great
War.
</p>

<p>
I did not see Frank when I came home after the
Service was over, as he never came down to breakfast:
but as I sat at my solitary meal I knew no loneliness:
the glory of the Great Reconciliation was about me
still.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast Jeavons came to me in a somewhat
deprecating manner.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to trouble you, Sir Reginald," he began,
"and I told Maggie Pearson so, but she wouldn't
take no, and begged me to come and give you her
message."
</p>

<p>
Maggie Pearson was the daughter of one of my
keepers&mdash;a respectable man with a tidy wife and a
large family.
</p>

<p>
"And what was her message?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Jeavons still appeared confused.  "I really did my
best, Sir Reginald, to make her understand that you'd
given up all that sort of thing and never went in for
it now, finding it more or less uncertain, as you might
say, and out of the usual course of events, and so not
altogether to be depended upon; and that she'd much
better stick to the doctor and not trouble you,
Mr. Wildacre being laid up in the house, and you with
enough on your hands as it is.  But she went on
crying, and said her mother'd never forgive her if she
didn't give you the message."
</p>

<p>
I felt that such unaccustomed loquacity was a sign
of serious mental disturbance on the part of Jeavons.
He was generally so very brief and to the point.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what <i>was</i> the message?" I repeated, with
(I cannot help thinking) commendable patience.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Sir Reginald, begging your pardon, the fact
is that Mrs. Pearson's baby is dying of brownchitis
or pewmonia or some other disease connected with its
teething, and nothing will satisfy her but that you
should come and lay your hands on it, like as was your
custom at one time, having outgrown it since.  I told
Maggie as how you had given up the habit long ago,
which she said her mother knew: but all the same,
Mrs. Pearson still persisted that she was sure you
could cure the baby if you tried, which was just like
her obstinacy, and to my thinking a great impertinence."
</p>

<p>
"Have they had the doctor, do you know?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Reginald, and he can't do nothing more
than what he has done, he says, and he is afraid the
child will die.  Though what they wants with that
extra child at all, beats me, having six besides, and
none too much food for them all, with the dreadful
war sending up the prices of everything."
</p>

<p>
For two years now I had refused all the villagers'
requests that I would exercise my gift of healing upon
them, as I knew, alas! that the gift was no longer
mine: and they had gradually ceased to proffer these
requests.  Therefore it struck me as noteworthy that
on the very day when, as the old theologists put it,
I had "found peace," I should be asked to exercise
this lost power once more.  It seemed to be one of
those wonderful instances of direct Interposition which
we of this faithless and perverse generation disguise
under the pseudonym of "remarkable coincidences."
</p>

<p>
"Tell Maggie that I will come at once," I said.
</p>

<p>
And Jeavons accordingly departed, leaving behind
him an atmosphere of respectful disapproval and
regret.  Anything bordering on the unusual&mdash;let alone
the miraculous&mdash;filled my excellent butler with horror
and dismay.
</p>

<p>
When I am tempted&mdash;as indeed I often am, and
frequently successfully&mdash;to despise those Jeavons-like
souls who delight to burrow in the commonplace
whenever the light of the supernatural shows above the
horizon, I remind myself of the first Order that was
given after the dread gates of death had been flung
open and the ruler's little daughter had come through
them back to life.  He Who had performed the
stupendous miracle did not take this unique opportunity
of preaching a sermon to the company assembled in
the house of mourning, with His Own Action as the
text: on the contrary "He commanded that something
should be given her to eat."
</p>

<p>
How joyfully those who had laughed Him to scorn
when He contradicted their conventional assumption
that death was the final ending&mdash;laughed, doubtless
with the uncomfortable, mocking laughter of all
materially minded people when confronted with things
undreamed of in their smug philosophy&mdash;must have
hurried to lay the table and prepare the meal, and
perform all the trivial little duties which form the
essence of the normal and the commonplace.  How
relieved they must have felt to find themselves
once more in the ordinary routine of everyday
existence!
</p>

<p>
And I like to think that it was then His turn to
smile&mdash;He Who knew them so well, and remembered
that they were but dust; yet the dust wherein He had
clothed Himself in order to identify Himself with them.
But I am sure that in His smile there was no scorn.
He knew what they needed, and He supplied all their
need.
</p>

<p>
Obedient to the Call which had come to me, I went
through the village, hardly conscious of any volition
on my own part.  I had merged my will in another's,
and had no longer any desire to act on my own initiative.
It is a strange feeling, this absolute surrender
of self, and brings with it that peace which the world
can never give nor take away.
</p>

<p>
Still as in a dream I entered the cottage at the far
end of the village, and found Mrs. Pearson rocking in
her arms her dying child; the other children hanging
round, all more or less in a state of tears.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mrs. Pearson," I said, when Maggie
had ushered me into the midst of the weeping
group.  "I have come because you sent for me."
</p>

<p>
"And right thankful I am to you, Sir Reginald,"
replied the poor woman: "I says to myself, when the
doctor give my baby up, 'If anybody can save her, Sir
Reginald can.'"
</p>

<p>
"I will do what I can," I said, "but it is years now
since I have had the power to heal anybody.  I lost it
when her ladyship went away."
</p>

<p>
"So I've heard, Sir Reginald.  But I minded that
story of the woman who wouldn't take 'No' even from
the Blessed Lord Himself, but begged for just the
crumbs under the table: and her child was healed in
consequence."
</p>

<p>
I knelt down beside the rocking-chair, and laid my
hands upon the little form lying on the mother's lap,
at the same time lifting up my whole soul in prayer.
And straightway the answer came&mdash;as in my heart of
hearts I had known it would come.  Like a mighty
electrical force the healing power rushed through me
to the child.  I could feel it in every vein and every
fibre of my body.  And at the same time my consciousness
of the Presence of Christ was so acute that
it was almost as if I actually saw and heard and felt
Him close beside me.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I prayed the moaning of the child ceased,
and its laboured breathing grew gradually soft and
easy: and when I rose from my knees and looked at it,
I knew that it would live.
</p>

<p>
The poor mother clung to my hand, and wept tears
of gratitude.  But I told her&mdash;as I always made a
point of telling those whom I was permitted to
help&mdash;that her thanksgivings were not due to me, but to
Another Whose messenger for the time I was allowed
to be: and then I hurried back through the village
to the Church, there to render thanks, with the rest of
the congregation at the office of Matins, for the blessings
that had (in my case so wonderfully) been vouchsafed to me.
</p>

<p>
When I returned home after the morning service, I
found Frank dressed and downstairs: but it was not
until lunch was over and we had settled down in our
usual places&mdash;he on the Chesterfield on one side of
the hall fire, and I in my easy-chair on the other&mdash;that
I found an opportunity of telling him, without
fear of interruption, of the marvellous thing that had
happened to me.
</p>

<p>
"Frank, my boy, I have something to say to you,"
I began.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Reggie, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"To me it is so wonderful that I find difficulty in
putting it into words.  But though I may be slow to
speak, you are always swift to hear, so I dare say you
will understand in spite of my blundering way of
telling it."
</p>

<p>
"Fire away," said Frank encouragingly.  "I shall
catch on right enough, never fear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, first and foremost, I want you to know that
I have forgiven you completely for any share that you
may have had in helping Fay to leave me."
</p>

<p>
Frank gave a little cry of joy.  "Oh, Reggie, how
splendid of you!" he began.
</p>

<p>
But I lifted up my hand to stop him.  "Wait a bit,
my boy.  Please hear all I have got to say before you
cut in.  I was going to tell you that I forgave you
freely because I had found that there was nothing to
forgive.  It sounds rather Irish, I know: but I think
you will understand that we are obliged to forgive
people when we think they have injured us, even when
we find they haven't really injured us at all.  I mean
we are bound to get back into love and charity with
them, whether the lapse from love and charity was
their fault or ours."
</p>

<p>
Frank nodded his head in the way that reminded
me so of Fay.  "I know exactly what you are driving
at.  When we quarrel with anybody we've got to bury
the hatchet before we can be happy or good again:
and the original ownership of the hatchet has no effect
whatever upon the importance of the funeral."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely so.  I'd got to forgive you whether you'd
done anything needing forgiveness or not: because I
believed you had, and acted according to that belief.
Therefore it was imperative upon me to root the
bitterness towards you out of my heart: the fact that the
bitterness to a great extent was undeserved, did not
altogether rob it of its flavour.  Well, then, that is
the first thing: I want you to know that at last I am
at peace with you after nearly three years of hot anger
against you: whether you in any way deserved that
anger, is your affair not mine."
</p>

<p>
Here Frank's enforced silence broke down.  "I
didn't deserve it as much as you thought, but I did
deserve it a bit.  I never tried to set Fay against
you: but when I saw she was set against you, I
induced her to cut and run, instead of using my
influence to make her see things in a different light, and
to bring you and her together again.  After all is said
and done, you were her husband: and when I saw the
bond between you was loosening I ought to have helped
to tie it tight again instead of undoing it altogether.
Let's try to be just all round!"
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to be just," I replied: "and therefore
I admit that though I myself was the principal culprit,
you were not altogether free from blame."
</p>

<p>
"No, I wasn't.  Neither was Fay, when you come
to that, though I know you won't let me say so."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I won't: so don't try it on.  Let us pass
on to the next thing.  And that is that as I have
forgiven you, so God has forgiven me, and has restored
to me my power of healing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Reggie, is that really true?  I minded that
more than anything!"  Frank's voice was hoarse with
emotion and his language was confused: but I
understood him right enough.
</p>

<p>
"Yes: I was instrumental in healing Mrs. Pearson's
baby this morning; the first time that I have been
permitted to do such a thing since Fay went away."  Then
I changed the subject hastily, with that shyness
which all Englishmen feel when speaking about the
matters that concern their own souls.  "And there is
yet another thing I want to say; that is to ask you
to make your permanent home with me here.  You
can go over and visit your relations in Australia as
often as you like; but I want you to feel that this is
your real home.  I have been very lonely ever since
Fay went away.  I was going to add, 'and ever since
Annabel was married,' but candidly I don't think that
really made much difference.  When the worst has
happened, minor troubles don't count.  But you seem
almost part of Fay&mdash;a sort of legacy that she has left
me, because she loved us both: and I feel that it would
please her if we devoted the rest of our lives to taking
care of each other."
</p>

<p>
Frank was trying so hard to choke back his sob
that he could not speak.  He was still very weak after
his awful experiences in Belgium.  So I went on,
order to give him time to recover himself.
</p>

<p>
"I think we shall be happy together, my boy, in a
second-rate sort of way; but we can never be really
perfectly happy until we see Fay again.  At least I
know I can't.  But that is the worst of wrong-doing,
or of any infringement of the great law of Love."  I
still continued talking, seeing that the boy was not
yet master of himself: "We repent our wrong-doing,
and God forgives us, and we know it will all come right
again some day: but not here, or now.  Between us
you and I managed to spoil Fay's life; and no
repentance of ours will set that right in this life, nor undo
the harm that we (however unconsciously) wrought.
There is no bringing the shadow on the dial ten degrees
backward.  We may pretend to ourselves that there
is, but there isn't really.  God still performs many
miracles, but not that one.  Of course He <i>could</i> if
He so willed it, but He certainly <i>doesn't</i>; and so what
is done is done, and what is past is past, and it is only
left to us to bear with God's help the consequences of
our own misdeeds."
</p>

<p>
To my surprise the usually undemonstrative Frank
sprang up from the couch where he was lying, and
flung himself on his knees beside my chair, at the same
time throwing his thin arms round my neck.  "Yes,
Reggie, He can," he gasped between his sobs: "He
can and He will and He does."
</p>

<p>
I turned my head in surprise, and for the first time
since Frank's return to Restham, I saw his face within
close range of my short-sighted eyes.  For a moment
I was literally paralysed with amazement, and my
heart and pulses seemed to stand still and then to
rush on in a very delirium of unheard-of joy.  For the
face into which I looked at such close quarters&mdash;the
face quivering with emotion and disfigured with tears,
and yet to me the dearest and most beautiful face in
the whole world&mdash;was not Frank's at all&mdash;but Fay's!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap24"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
CONCLUSION
</h3>

<p>
This then is the story of the drama of my life; the
story of how in my case the greatest miracle of all was
accomplished, and the shadow on the dial was brought
ten degrees backward.  She who had been dead was
alive again, she who had been lost was found.  The
past was given back to me to be lived over again, with
its misdeeds expiated and its mistakes retrieved.
</p>

<p>
I learnt from my darling that the greater part of
what she had told me was absolutely true; only that
it was Frank who gave his life to save the child that
was playing in the sun when the shells began to fall
in that doomed street of Louvain&mdash;not Fay.
</p>

<p>
So Frank Wildacre died the death of a hero: for
there is no more glorious death for any man than to
give his life for another's.  Again it struck me afresh,
as it had often struck me before, how since the beginning
of the Great War the prophecy had been literally
fulfilled that the last should be first, and the first last.
Frank, who had been thoughtless and irresponsible
and frivolous, had been called to lay down his life for
one of those little ones whose angels do always behold
the Face of the Father: whilst I, who had taken the
world so seriously, and had ever longed to do great
deeds and think high thoughts, was left amongst the
useless ones at home.  Yet we were all part of the
great army of the living God, and it was not for us to
pick and choose who should go forth with the hosts
and who should stay at home by the stuff.  That was
all left in the Hands of "Our Captain, Christ, under
Whose colours we had fought so long."
</p>

<p>
Frank only lived for about an hour after he was hit.
They managed to carry him into a house, but there
was no hope from the first.  He was conscious almost
to the end; and he devoted those last moments to
careful thought for his sister.  He told her to cut off
her long hair and dress herself up in his clothes, and
try to get away to England as soon as she could, as
it was not safe for her to remain in Belgium now that
he was no longer there to take care of her: and as
terrible and ghastly rumours were already current as
to the unspeakable way in which the ruthless invaders
were treating such women as were hapless enough to
fall into their hands, he thought Fay would be safer
if her sex were not known.  And so he fell on sleep.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Frank had passed to his well-earned
reward, Fay followed out all his instructions to the
letter, and succeeded, after many vicissitudes, in
escaping to England with a crowd of Belgian refugees.  No
one penetrated her disguise&mdash;not even Isabel Chayford,
who put down Fay's extraordinary likeness to
her own self to the fact that she and Frank were twins,
and so were expected to resemble one another.  And
Fay kept to her own room most of the time that she
was at the Chayfords', for fear Isabel should discover
her identity.  Ponty found her out at once: there was
never any deceiving Ponty!  But Fay could always
twist my old nurse round her little finger, and
therefore Ponty kept her secret for her.
</p>

<p>
To this hour I cannot conceive how I could have
been such a fool as not to know my darling the moment
I set eyes on her.  But the grim fact remains that I
am by nature a fool, and this was one of the occasions
of my displaying my folly.  My one excuse&mdash;and a
feeble one it is!&mdash;is my extreme short-sightedness: the
first moment that Fay's dear face was close to my
own I recognised her like a shot: but lying in the
Chesterfield on the other side of the fire-place, with
her short curly hair and elfin face, she looked so like
Frank that I took it for granted she was Frank; and
she was so much aged and changed, alas! by all she
had suffered, that she had lost much of her likeness
to the Fay of the past.  As to her voice, Frank's was
so high for a man's and hers was so deep for a woman's
that I frequently had mistaken the one for the other
in the old days: so no wonder I did so now, when I
was convinced in my own mind that Fay was dead,
and that Frank was talking to me from the other side
of the great fire-place.
</p>

<p>
I gathered that Fay's original idea was to find out
whether or not I had forgiven her.  If I had, she
meant to reveal herself to me and to ask me to take
her back as my wife: but if I had not forgiven her,
she intended to return to Australia, leaving me with
the idea that she was dead and I was free.  A wild,
childish scheme, just like my impracticable darling!
</p>

<p>
But when Isabel told her how deeply my anger
against Frank had eaten into my very soul, destroying
my gift of healing and coming between me and
my God, Fay realised that there was far more at stake
than just the relations between herself and me.  The
salvation of my soul was hanging in the balance, and
it was for her dear hands to adjust the scales.  With
an insight beyond her years, she understood that
before I could find peace I must forgive Frank, believing
him to be alive: the easy forgiveness which we accord
to the dead, who can no longer hurt or be hurt by us,
was not the thing that was demanded of me.  I was
called upon to forgive Frank fully and freely, even
although I believed that it was through him that my
darling had gone to her death, and that therefore there
was no possibility of her ever coming back to me, or
of the wrong which he had done me ever being
rectified.
</p>

<p>
This my darling enabled me to do, and thereby saved
my soul alive.
</p>

<p>
And now we are once more all in all to each other;
and the love that is stronger than death can lighten
even the long shadows cast by the Great War.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I do not think there is any more to add to my story,
save the interesting fact that we have christened our
first-born son <i>Francis</i>.
</p>

<p>
At present he finds his sole occupation in mewling
and puking in his nurse's arms; but his beloved mother
and I have every reason to hope that eventually he
will learn to employ his time with more profit both

I think that some day "Sir Francis Kingsnorth" will
be quite an effective name and sound very well indeed.
But I shall not be there to hear it.

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
